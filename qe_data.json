Clearly this is not going to boost my > application  The personal consequences for you of being labeled on your application as a white male are not something that anyone can predict with any certainty. Even assuming that the data are visible to the people evaluating your application (which is probably not the case), the putative effect would depend on things like the individual attitudes of people evaluating your application. These attitudes would be variable and we have no way of measuring them.  Keep in mind that any pile of applications in mathematics in the US is going to contain vast numbers of white males, so even if there were some very strong bias against you, or some extremely aggressive affirmative action program, the result can't possibly be to exclude all white males.  Since the actual consequences of your disclosing your information or not disclosing it are unknowable and probably negligible on an individual level, your guess about those consequences is not a good criterion on which to base your choice.  You might instead want to base this on your political opinions. Reasonable people can be for or against the idea of having the US federal government classify people into racial categories. An example of a reason for: a horrific national history of slavery and oppression, which we could try to undo to some extent. An example of a reason against: race is a nonsensical and artificial construct, and there is no logical way to apply it to people of mixed race.  If your personal utopia is one that lies on one side or the other of this issue, be the change that you want to make.  "

Answer: **They are inaccurate, but moreover - they are simply _not_ \"checker[s] for plagarisms\"**, even if some of those programs have names which appear to claim the contrary.  The reason is that _plagiarism_ is a subtle concept; determining whether some piece of writing P is plagiarized or not requires, in many cases, a proper understanding of the contents of P as well as of the context of P. Understanding those things is far beyond what software can currently (2022) do.  What software tools like the one you showed in your question really do is some kind of automated (probably statistical) analysis of texts, and highlighting of some parts of the text. The output of the software does not determine whether something is plagiarism. The fact that such a tool shows some absurd text message as a result (such as \"33% plagiarized content\" in your screenshot) tells us something about the software, not about the text it analyzed.  "

In tests on my work it's often not able to identify my original sources (from which there may well be a few phrases I did take verbatim), it suggests I've plagiarised from sources I've never seen, it claims that trivially short phrases and even single words are plagiarised, and, perhaps most astonishingly, it claims that large portions of my text are unique when it's comparing against a copy of that same document.  To see how this particular plagiarism checker works I took a couple of items from my personal technical notes and ran them through it. I picked [this item on the technical details of video standards](https://github.com/0cjs/sedoc/blob/master/8bit/video.md) (dropping the last part to get it under 2000 characters) and [this item on the design of the CMake language](https://github.com/0cjs/sedoc/blob/master/lang/cmake/README.md) because these notes happen to have taken a particularly large amount of work to properly write up. (The first one because it's a complex topic where I had to use a lot of different sources, and the second one because CMake documentation is just terrible at explaining the core principles of the language design.) I am quite sure that these notes bear little resemblance to the original sources because I wouldn't have had to put such much work into them otherwise. (I am not particularly concerned about plagiarism in the notes I take for personal use in any event, but it's unlikely there would be much anyway because if a source is already in the form I need, I would just link to it rather than re-typing it.)  These didn't come out as high as your example did, 16% and 22% respectively, but some characteristics of the output are interesting to note.  In the first example it identified 22 \"plagiarised\" bits. Almost all of them are from pages that were not sources I used. I checked only the first few before it started to seem rather pointless because without exception in the ones I checked the text given in the plagiarism match was from my document and there was nothing resembling that text in the source to which they linked. (In the case of a link to a BBC page, the source had not only no technical information about video standards, but almost no text at all.) Several of the matches were for a single word and, in a particularly hilarious example, the word \"this\" from the Merriam Webster thesaurus:  [![Merriam Webster thesaurus: \"this\"](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VB1Lb.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VB1Lb.png)  (There was more than one of those, actually.)  In the second example it correctly identified \"plagiarism\" from my on-line copy of the document linked above. (Given that it's from the same repo on GitHub as the first one, I have no idea why it failed to find the copy of the first one.) But somehow it decided that, though it was comparing against _exactly the same document_ (albeit formatted slightly differently) the copy I'd given it was still \"78% Unique Content.\"  I couldn't even be bothered for this one to chase down the sources given by the checker, but I am pleased to note that the letter \"g\" followed by a period is apparently quite original to me:  [![\"g.\"](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvwYC.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/cvwYC.png)  (I am guessing this is from one of the five uses of \"e.g.\" I made in the text.)

All they can do is identify _candidates_ for closer inspection and the bar is usually pretty low on what it takes to become a candidate. From there, it takes a human to carefully review the evidence (the matches) that were found and apply experience and judgement to decide if it's compelling.  They work well for what they're designed to do, quickly comparing a set of submissions against a vast database of possible sources that may have been plagiarized and producing a ranked list of submissions worth reviewing.  We used the MOSS (measure of software similarity) system at Stanford to do cheat-checking for one of our large intro CS classes at Michigan, each time comparing 1000+ new submissions against each other and our archive of roughly 10K prior submissions. This would have been impossible by hand. It scored and ranked the results and did a good job of identifying matching sections. For example, it wasn't fooled by common obfuscation, like variable renaming, simple expression rewriting, statement reordering, rewriting a for as a while, changes to comments, and so on. It really is very good at this.  If it flagged 30 submissions, we might commonly write up six to perhaps a dozen after a careful discussion with my cheat-checking team. We often agreed the rest were a little suspicious, but there just wasn't enough evidence to support a case. By these numbers, you might argue we saw a false positive rate of 40% to 80%. But as a practical matter, what we also experienced was that the cases we reported were usually the ones MOSS ranked highest.  While plagiarism detectors work well at comparing a large set of submissions against another far-larger set of possible sources of plagiarism to find possible matches, they do not work well on an individual submission except to produce a list of the closest matches it found, which may not be good matches at all.  The ranking score for a single result is completely meaningless. Ranking scores are only helpful for sorting a list of suspects (or similarly, search engine results) because rank values only have to obey ordering, not linearity. (A score of .8 may be better than .4, but it's probably not twice as good.) You need the context of other submissions it scored higher or lower to know what a score means.  In your case, you've reviewed the output and decided there's no real match. Good for you. It was a false positive, which is no surprise because these tools generate _lots_ of false positives. (And presumably, you already knew you didn't plagiarize anyway.)  If you expect a plagiarism detector to be right most of the time, you're going to be wrong most of the time.  "

During this period I wanted to know how it feels to do research. Personally I am more interested in pure mathematics. As a result, I searched for around 20 open problems (not Riemannian hypothesis, small and unknown open problems) to see if I can achieve anything new about them to publish.  The problems did not need much to be understood, mostly in combinatorics, linear algebra and analysis. I was able to find new results about 2 of them, meaning that, I was not able to find any article that mentioned my results. However, I always feel my results are very bad and have low quality and I feel if I submit them to any journals I will only hurt myself. To explain a little bit more how my results look, I should say I was able to prove some special cases of the problem and find another elementary proof of one of the theorems that someone else found using advanced techniques. So by no means, I do not feel I did anything worthy of publishing.  However, when I am looking around the internet I see people publish results that are really easy to achieve, for example an elementary proof of Fermat equation for case 11. During my journey I found out achieving very good results will take years, those problems won't be solved easily and there is a reason that they are open for years if not decades.  So if we want to call a person a good pure mathematical researcher, does that mean solving very difficult conjectures only?

No, mathematicians don't always work on or publish only the hardest of problems. Some of those have taken hundreds of years to resolve, not to mention new technology to assist. Some problems are very niche and contribute something of interest to only a few people. They can be significant, but the main interests of the moment are elsewhere. My dissertation was like that. One of it's main useful features is that it gave me insight into a class of problems.  Also note that you don't suddenly become an olympic level swimmer the first time in the pool. It takes years of practice and probably the aid of a good and observant coach.  If you think you have a worthy result you can take a small step and share it with some other more skilled mathematician asking for feedback. You can also take a large step and submit it to an appropriate journal and rely on the review process to get feedback on its structure and value. If it is terrible you will learn quickly in most cases. If it is worthy but needs improvement you will get some feedback on that (most cases).  But, you have to get in the pool to start the process, which you seem to be doing.  "

        "answer_body": "  I'm not a mathematician, but I will try to explain you the general principle of deciding whether a research result is worth publishing.  Whether your research findings are a result of hard work or were derived in just an hour is pretty much irrelevant, and what's actually important is their significance. Ask yourself the following question: how will my findings impact the research area? How will they be used by other researchers? If you have something positive to say in response to these questions, then your result is worth publishing at least somewhere.  Next step: try to somehow quantify the significance of your research result in order to determine the best suitable journal. You can make a crude estimate based on the impact factor. Every journal has an impact factor, which is essentially how many times papers in that journal get cited per year on average within the two years following the publication year. So, ask yourself how many citations you expect per year. To figure out the answer, you can have a look at citation stats for papers that address problems of similar significance in your research area.  Also, keep in mind that different journals have different scopes and styles. There are journals for relatively short letters, and there are journals for long detailed articles.  One more thing to consider is that writing a paper takes time and effort, so you should weigh what's more beneficial for your career - spending time on writing up the results you have at hand or trying to get more significant results instead. And the choice here depends on your survival strategy in academia: some people publish like crazy to build a long publication list, while others strive to publish in top journals and achieve impressive citation stats. So, if you want to impress potential employers by a long publication list, publish everything you can - the more the better. But if you want to impress them by the quality of your research, then an almost uncited publication in a subpar journal won't help you much.  So, the issue boils down to what you are as a researcher, and no one is going to tell you exactly what you have got to be. You've got to decide about it yourself.  "

I worked hard to be accepted and took several state university courses, both excelling in lower-level reqs and some upper-level ones doneto get here as well as conference research + olympiad achievment in relevant fields.  I\u2019ve always had dreams of going to a great R1 grad school, but this semester I finally caved, scoring projected B range grades across the board (maybe even a C). So much of this was due to a shattering in work ability largely caused by physical health problems that emerged when I got here. The first two months were nicely motivating because of college\u2019s novelty, but the last two came to break me and it killed my final exam performance even though my homework averages and midterm performances were decent.  Well, I\u2019m taking the part-2 iteration of these sequences (algebra and analysis) and am determined to do better when finishing off the semester, but can\u2019t help but feel ashamed especially when I had so much momentum.  Will drive and exceptional performance alone from here on out, including in graduate courses beginning next year in the same topics dig me out of this hole, when considering REUs and/or quant trading internships beginning summer of 2024?  I know I already threw away industry internships for this summer, but was hoping to do some research with a professor/group here and take a few summer courses to up my GPA, citing my previous experience as a strong point.  I was asked about if one of the generic FAQ pages answered my question - what I meant to ask was how might I be able to score math-related research this summer. I know that there's a barrier to meaningful research in pure math due to training requirements, but I hope to counteract this by being accelerated during some point in my time here.  ",

Your previous experience is probably not going to hurt you, especially since you got results that were sufficiently interesting to publish. Indeed, having publications is \"gravy\" in the sense that most undergrads don't manage to publish anything. Most profs will look at that and be pleased even if it is in another subject area.  If you can find time to do some classes in your areas of interest that will help also.  Hopefully the profs you worked with will remember you and be happy to give you a LOR.  Also, many governments (and most grad schools) have scholarships, and usually you have to apply to them to be considered. So scope out the schools you are interested in and find those scholarships.

At that time, I wanted to pursue a Master by Research degree (MPhil) after graduation, so I accepted the offer as having some research experience would be helpful for my graduate admission. However, it was an unpaid job. I was living in Melbourne, and the living cost was really high here. I had to work part-time to cover the living cost. As the result, I did not spend enough time on doing research. I decided to quit.  Later, professor A managed to find a source of funding for the research project, and he offered me a new opportunity to work with him. He really wanted me to do MPhil and PhD at the same university after graduation. It was a paid RA job. I decided to quit the part-time job, and focused on doing research. We have not achieved any significant result since then.  Unfortunately, due to COVID-19, the university faced financial challenges. They decided to cut funding for research students. It has become extremely difficult for potential MPhil students to get the research scholarship (tuition fee waiver + stipend) unless students have a publication(s) prior to applying. His field of research is also not a priority of the university.  As the result, he has worked so hard to get me opportunities to participate in research projects from other research groups at the university. He always suggests me new topics and upcoming conferences, telling me that I should try to publish something there. There was one occasion when he told me to submit a manuscript to a conference when there were literally only 3 weeks left before the submission deadline, and I had from zero because we had not done any research on that topic before. (2) Of course, I did not manage to do it and wasted my time.  I have completely lost the motivation to do research, and I no longer want to work in academia. I have decided to quit again. However, just a few days ago, he managed to get a new research opportunity for me. He told me that I would work with a research group in United States, and they were going to submit a manuscript next year. Now, he sends me emails everyday talking about that project, and I am so anxious everytime I see new emails from him.  I want to refuse the offer, but I don't want to hurt his feelings. What should I do in this situation? How to tell him that I want to quit?  * * *  Additional details:  (1) I don't have any other job offer at the moment. I am thinking of enrolling in a master by coursework program after graduation instead.  (2) The stress affected my mental health.

My favourite course is quantum mechanics and recently I became fascinated by the whole quantum computing research. However, when I find any summer school/scholarship/internship offer, the requirement is mostly cs/physics/maths/engineering degree:(  Should I change my degree to have any chances to go far? Because honestly I have a lot of both physics and mathematics courses during my degree and I'm learning Python on my own, so I don't feel like I'm far behind compared to other degrees. Do you think putting in the extra effort like online courses and learning to program can be enough alongside my chemistry degree (probably with physics or cs minor, haven't decided yet) or should I really consider changing my major?  edit: I'm from Poland but studying in the Netherlands  ",

        "answer_body": "  Sometimes a \"CS/Physics/Engineering-degree\"-requirement will mean that they just sort out everyone not having one of those; something they'll be willing to consider your argument for why you are actually qualified after all. It is hard to predict just how many more opportunities you'd have with a more fitting major.  Since you are still quite early in your degree, you should certainly consider changing major if you are confident that quantum computing is what you want to do.  Some questions to ponder for that:    1. How much time to graduation would you actually lose when changing now? (My guess would be just a year.)    2. What are the courses you'd take in the third year of your chemistry BSc? Are any of those relevant for quantum computing at all?    3. Would you be doing an MSc or a PhD after the Bachelor? What are the requirements to get into those? Once you have the \"right\" postgraduate degree, a not-quite-right undergraduate degree wouldn't really matter anymore.    4. How sure are you that quantum computing is your \"one true love\"?  "

        "answer_body": "  There are a few relevant questions here:    * How will your future grad school applications be treated if your eventual degree is chemistry    * How do you get to know better that quantum computing as a field will be where you can best pursue your career    * How do you prepare yourself better for pursuing a career in quantum computing  I am going to talk about the last one.  I'll organize the things you can do into 2 categories: research & study.  You should try to find research internship in quantum computing. Various countries have their own scholarship system for undergrad participating in research where the funding contribution requirement from the PI is minimal. Look those up. Often, even if you study in Netherland, there is no restriction for you to apply to, say, a Canadian department via NSERC's scholarship program.  Your eventual goal (while in undergrad) should be to have publication(s) before the end of undergrad or come close to it. If you are one of the authors of a good quality paper, I would hazard to guess that your degree title won't be a problem with any admission committee. (Do check with ppl with actual admission committee experience. I don't.)  With that, as you search for research groups that interest you, you can ask what background a specific research group would need from you for you to do an undergrad project with them. Between the PI and the department, they will also be able to tell you how you can be competitive in getting the scholarship and the placement.  Typically, good overall grade at your current program is required. And then there will be other things. So, keep your grades good. Drop courses you strongly dislike early to avoid tanking your grade, for example. Those other things likely include courses relevant to the research topic you will propose with the PI. That's why your course load should likely be different from a typical chemistry major. A side-effect is: if you missed some chemistry courses that another student would have at the same year at your institute, it won't be noticed.  If and when you do interact with researchers in this manner, do specifically ask what review paper or conference presentation or other introductory materials they would recommend for you to understand the related areas for quantum computing -- in order for you to guide your study before switching degree/institution. For example, obviously theoretical computer science is related. Theoretical computer science, however, is a large and diverse field. Studying theoretical computer science topics broadly will get you nowhere in terms of pursuing a career in quantum computing (other than getting you smarter, which I suppose could be limitless in itself; but let's not be pedantic here.)  The second half about mentioning that you would like guidance before switching degree/institution leads to the next point I will comment.  Switching degree/institution for an intellectual pursuit is admirable. Hopefully people will relate to that. They will also hopefully understand its gravity and therefore understand why you would need their guidance in the first place -- as opposed to from your own institute and your own degree program.  The gravity part should be understood by yourself as well.  How do you know quantum computing is for you? How do you know more whether you will be successful in quantum computing?  I'll leave that to yourself and others. I think getting to know more about quantum computing and the contributing disciplines will help. So let's talk about those.  I would suggest you start taking some math courses: linear algebra and real analysis. Linear algebra courses can often be matrix algebra in reality. You need exposure to the theory side of linear algebra.  As with any other subjects, you can potentially take a more applied course and supplement with your own study to gain exposure to the theory side. And you can ask subject-specific questions separately. e.g. \"which textbooks are good if I want to understand the theories behind linear algebra with an eye on applications to quantum mechanics and quantum computing\". And then people may answer: Friedberg, Hoffmann. etc.  You should also try to take quantum theory courses. Your introductory quantum mechanics course likely focused on hydrogen atoms and the solution to Schrodinger's equation with harmonic potential. You should ask separate questions on what \"quantum theory\" would entail. But say, why should Schrodinger's equation even be valid in the first place and why does it have the form it does? Maybe a quantum theory course would cover materials necessary to answer such questions.  I would also suggest taking some lab courses in physics. Many things in that umbrella can help actually. You should ask a separate question as usual.  Some computer science courses may help. Same with information theory. Statistics. The list can go on. The issues with these subjects though is that I would expect the relevant courses for you have tons of pre-requisite that are _not_ relevant for you. That's why I don't recommend them. You can also ask a separate question like \"what computer science courses should I take to help pursue a career in quantum computing\" etc.  Note that thus far I have not mentioned anything about alternative degree. One quick tip first: keep an eye out for degree programs at your institute that have requirements that are close to the courses that you eventually shortlist for yourself. That could be how you find the degree to switch into.  Other than the above tip, my advise is actually: you do not have to switch degree before you start to prepare. You can first prepare and explore before you eventually switch degree or even institute.  You prepare by knowing more about quantum computing and gaining hard skills/knowledge that are foundational to quantum computing. The eventual goal (in undergrad) for you should be to get research scholarship **s** and be a part of a research publication.  The emphasis on plural here is intentional. Research can be hard. It can take you a few internship to be productive eventually.  So start prepping early!  I guess, that's a good ender.  "

Probably less than any other researcher because you lack the training but not zero. What mistakes to avoid? Well, that is what research education partly is about.  Writing a paper involves many aspects, providing the proper background, explaining the research, putting the research in perspective and reaching proper conclusions. There are many mistakes that can be made: you do not show you know the field, you do not describe the methods/theory/experiments well enough, your discussion does not hold and your conclusions are not well founded. All of this can come from poor understanding or from not writing well. So as long as you can tick the boxes from the subject specific to the methodological including writing skills then you would stand as reasonable a chance as any. In the end there is likely only one way to find out, try.  You state that you work independently and that is all fine. But, in science we all benefit from having others read and comment on our work to improve it so your chances of success can increase dramatically if your writing can be read and commented on by peers (with at least a PhD would be recommended) to weed out problems and any lack of clarity.

But, as others have mentioned, you almost certainly lack experience and understanding of the field to explain _why_ you did it and what impact your work has.  And most experienced researchers are able to spot some common issues in the presentation, even in topics they do not know much about.  Corollaries:    1. You can publish, and I would absolutely encourage you to try. Mighty oaks from little acorns grow.   2. It is a lot easier for a student to publish a research paper solo rather than to publish a literature review, although the latter is also commonly done - as a part of a thesis project and under supervision.   3. One potential issue might be presentation. You should enlist some help to review the article before sending it to a journal.   4. Another could be a flawed experimental design (if it is experimental research we are concerned with). This is what training is for, and it is hard: very few can get it right, much less first try. Do not let that discourage you, however: this is where practice and feedback are especially helpful. More on that point later.   5. Yet another issue does not have to do with research but with the submission process. From personal experience and communications, it could be an unexpectedly enormous roadblock. Suppose you read enough literature, and you also got an interesting result and wrote a paper about it, and this paper looks no worse than what you see out there... Now what? Teaching you the process of picking a journal, submitting a publication, and interacting with its editorial office and reviewers is yet another role typically assumed by an advisor. You may or may not find this problematic, but if you end up struggling, again, enlist help.  Now, to expand on the experiment design... One piece of advice I could give you is this: before doing anything, pretend for a moment your experiments showed very favorable results, the best you could plausibly imagine. Try to describe them; do they make for a convincing case? If not, this is a bad, bad design; figure out what is missing. Do not underestimate this pitfall, it is far more common than you think.  Then, consider what happens if the results were very weak, sitting firmly at the previously established baseline. No improvement at all. Could you extract any knowledge from that? If not, this is still fine, but consideration should be given, especially as the experiments get more and more laborious.  Good luck!  "

What you are proposing is consistent with the types of research projects academics undertake that lead to publications. If these algorithm extensions are something you are interested in then it sounds like an enjoyable project that could potentially lead to publication.  If you pursue this project, make sure your paper gives the appropriate background to your problem and cites this other paper. You could consider targeting the same journal where this other paper was published in the first instance. Since you are only an undergraduate student, you might have some difficulty writing to the standard of work expected in academic journals, so you might also consider getting some preliminary feedback from an experienced academic in your field prior to submission.

        "answer_body": "  Of course! Building on prior work is _the_ way people do research.  If you look at the literature on (say) matrix or graph operations, you'll find plenty of work where people refine a general-purpose algorithm to exploit some special feature of the problem, like sparsity or symmetry. There's also a great deal of interest in adapting algorithms to fit different types of computation: parallel/distributed processing, resource-constrained environments, or branchless/cache-oblivious versions of an algorithm.  Without knowing the specific details of your problem and proposed solution, and field, it is hard to say what would be expected for a publication. This will also vary a great deal from venue to venue. In general, I think it is often easier to publish _algorithmic_ advances that improve the asymptotic runtime (e.g., O(N\u00b2) to O(N log N)) or performance on a benchmark. Optimizations of a specific _implementation_ via clever coding may be harder to publish as a CS paper, but might find a home in the \"applied\" literature if you really polish the implementation and build it into a library/toolkit.  There are plenty of exceptions\u2014and pitfalls\u2014so a conversation with an experienced researcher in your field would be a great next step. You may also want to consider whether this could be the basis for an Honors Thesis or Independent Study course, which would provide a more formal structure for advising.  "

      "question_title": "Applying to Math PhD programs from Weak Undergraduate  ",
      "question_body": "  First, some information about me. I\u2019m a senior at a small liberal arts school at the US (I will be graduating in 3 years because I took a bunch of college courses in high school), and my heart is set on a PhD in mathematics. My ultimate goal would be to work as a professor of mathematics and do research.  I am becoming extremely concerned that my application is too weak to have any hope of being accepted to a sufficiently strong graduate school to have any chance whatsoever of actually entering academia. My primary concerns are twofold:  First, the mathematics courses offered at my university are (so it seems to me) woefully inadequate. Upon graduation I will have taken literally every single math course offered (excluding stuff like business calculus). So far I\u2019ve taken numerical analysis, mathematical statistics, graph theory, modern geometry, and linear algebra and I am currently taking abstract algebra and intro to proofs. I took Calc 1-3 and differential equations in high school. Next semester (my last before I graduate) I will be taking complex analysis, and two independent studies in real analysis and number theory. My greatest concern here is that the level of the courses I am taking is far below what might be expected of a prospective PhD student. I say this because all of the math courses I\u2019ve taken (with the exception of mathematical statistics) have been extremely easy for me. As in, I hardly needed to pay attention in class and almost never had to study (I received A\u2019s in all but geometry and mathematical stat). My abstract algebra class (infuriatingly) de-emphasizes proof writing in favor of \u201ccomputations and concepts\u201d  Second, and also the impetus for writing this post, is my subject GRE (more precisely, my lack thereof). I was registered to take it today, but I lost my ID and they wouldn\u2019t let me sit the test. The next one is not until April, i.e., after my grad school applications are finished. All of the schools I am applying to list the GRE as optional, but I was counting on a good GRE score to show admissions committees that I do actually have some competence in undergraduate mathematics, but that is now out the window. I know that this point is squarely my own fault, and I accept that, but it still bothers me tremendously and is a great source of concern.  So as not to make this post a complete downer, I\u2019ll conclude by discussing what I see as my biggest asset, my research experience. Since the summer of 2021 I\u2019ve been working continuously on a research project in graph theory under the advisement of one of my professors. I\u2019ve generated a paper with (I think) some very nice results, and I\u2019ve done this essentially by myself with my advisor providing some occasional feedback. I presented a poster on this project at MathFest earlier this year, and I will be giving two more talks on it at conferences next month and in January.  So, in light of all the above information, I\u2019d really appreciate some brutally honest assessments of my chances, as well as any advice you may offer about what can be done to improve those chances. I accept that there is a very real possibility that I will be rejected from all the schools I apply to, but I am not willing to let that be the end of it.  If that does end up happening, I will take another year to try to shore up my application as much as possible (via research and/or auditing graduate classes). If, god forbid, I am rejected everywhere two years in a row I suppose that will be a sign to call it quits.  Edit: it\u2019s also worth mentioning I have a great deal of experience tutoring anything Calc 2 and below. This experience is both private and through my university.  ",

Also, the rewards for supervising undergraduate theses is usually quite slim, implying that people are not going out of their way to supervise undergraduate research. If someone is willing to supervise you, and has not expressed any doubts about their suitability, then in their judgment, they are capable of supervision.  However, as long as you did not ask the lecturer to supervise you formally, there is no obligation on you.

It sounds like something I should be asking HR about before I could agree to anything, and you being overseas would make things even messier. \"Research assistant\" is a job title, and being one might make you a member of the hosting university. Not asking for money means that no funding is needed, but this doesn't necessarily make the paperwork any easier. Also, some (many?) people feel that it is unethical to volunteer for something others would expect to get paid for.  In my eyes, it is a completely different picture if instead you seek to collaborate with a researcher on a particular project. This wouldn't put you in any kind of hierarchical structure, and being an independent researcher is a perfectly valid hobby.  The second issue is the question what you can actually offer. Most opportunities where inexperienced people can contribute well are in-person tasks (cleaning laboratory equipement seems to be a popular task to give to students seeking research experience). In my area (math/TCS), it would be very difficult for someone lacking experience to make any positive contribution, and accepting to work with a stranger would make little sense to me.

In the US, professors do not expect undergraduate students to produce something new in their thesis unless it is somewhat straight-forward (such as simulating a new, simple network protocol or finding linear regression relations in a given dataset). When undergraduate research is made mandatory, it is almost always under the direction of a faculty member who is supposed to mentor the undergraduate student. This person will be able to say whether a literature review is sufficient.

Sometimes a literature review might count as a research experience though it is not what people understand under this term. You say that you do not have a supervisor. You might want to wait until you have one or if you want a head-start and risk being told off, ask some students who went before you what they did.

The class \"Advanced Econometrics\" that I'm taking right now is an honors class where we read papers, discussions etc and also write a research paper studying an economics topic. The main concepts of this class are about linear regression, data analysis, etc, so it is an empirical economics class. Should I get a letter of recommendation from this professor? Note that I am applying to the Theoretical Computer Science group, so this economics research is going to be very different from what I might see in a CS program. So, I am thinking about whether I should get this guy's letter or not. Or should I just get it from a CS professor? I do have research in CS as well over the summer and the mentor from that program will be one of my letter writers.  The pro is that it is an honors class and involves economics research. The con is that the work is from outside CS. What should I do? I've read how PhD programs emphasize letter writers to talk about students' abilities on doing research.  ",

I studied math and wrote something like a thesis (honors thesis) in the philosophy of math. Lots of reading, thought, writing, but no real guidance. It was pretty muddled at the end, though I guess the grade was good. Not something to look back on with a lot of pride years later though.

However, this project is in a branch of CS that is not related to their research expertise at all. So I have been on my own to to read papers to see what the SOTA is and try to come up with algorithms. In our meetings, the professor likes to see my work but the ideas he proposes show that this isn't their area of research and is unaware of SOTA algorithms. Furthermore, there is no one at my university who is specializing at this research currently. The way I saw research is to improve upon the SOTA or to develop innovative algorithms to achieve some task, however I don't see that happening without some expertise in the domain.  I have a very high amount of respect the professor, however I don't see myself getting very far by myself and without any fellow undergrad/grad students. Has anyone been in a similar situation?

Of course there may be obstacles to this if you are graduating (sometimes positions can only be available to current students), but there's absolutely nothing to be cagey or secretive about. Graduate students are usually expected to go study somewhere besides where they were as an undergraduate. It's very natural both to a) have a backup plan and b) for your primary plan to be something besides being an undergraduate researcher for the rest of your life.  Whenever your next opportunity arises for a conversation, I'd simply ask your professor directly: \"If I'm not successful in applying to graduate school this year, is it possible I could continue working for pay here in your lab?\" is entirely appropriate. It's good to have this conversation early to help in planning finances. Your advisor should be hoping that your graduate applications are successful, but if they are able to support you they are likely to appreciate having an experienced worker continue.  I'm writing from the perspective of someone in the biomedical sciences in the US, where there is typically a fair amount of funding and flexibility available to support both undergraduate students and recent graduates in lab positions.

In general, if you are an undergraduate then citations won't matter. It depends on the place and the position you're applying for. Again, another factor remains, i.e., the number of people applying for that same job position. In this situation, the organization that posted for the job vacancy would have to make a decision to choose the _right candidate_ for their vacancy. Now, the word `'right candidate'` is relative in nature.  When a huge number of candidates apply for a single job position then one of the ways the recruiters tend to choose is to find ways to reject a candidate. If this happens then a higher number of publications( _and/or citations_ ) would give you a better edge. But it's all relative to the situation you are in. The choosing criteria can be absurd sometimes, but having a good research publication and citation at your level would always provide you with an extra edge.  You also have to `look into the job requirements carefully` to find out how much your research and publications are related to the specific requirements of the research-related job you mentioned.  So, No, there is no proper rule for undergraduates to have citations until you stand out in their eyes in some way or the other. That can be your research, your attitude towards the job, your direct relation( _your previous research and publications_ ) to the job criteria or sometimes even a good recommendation. A large number of factors can contribute to your success in getting the job.  "

With relatively little prerequisite knowledge and mathematical maturity , you may be wasting you time reading some very advanced papers .    * High risk of having little demonstrable research progress . Related to previous point . This\u2019s especially important in your case .  That\u2019s why I recommend consult relevant professors first and    * Check out undergraduate research opportunities program (UROP) or something similar at your university . An advisor may be assigned to you , which may write you a reference letter and help you . There may also be courses to teach you research skills . Those\u2019re usually offered in summer term .    * Boost you prerequisite knowledge , mainly for reading papers and you also have more tools to implement your ideas . Many papers assume you know advanced calculus & linear algebra and statistics , of course depending on your field .    * Improve presentation skills with PowerPoint . Explain technical concepts succinctly . This may also help you in interviews .    * Explore your interest by investigating different topics at high level . Also pay attention to lectures , sometimes professors may briefly mention a few \u2018keywords\u2019 , if they interest you then do further investigation . Recruiters may value your ambition & interest .  A final note to university freshman is that your \"ultimate objective\" may change , don\u2019t tie yourself up to any certain identity without good reason .  "

To be considered you need an application that is supported by letters of recommendation by people who can be trusted to know the requirements but also trusted to give you a very positive letter of recommendation. People who don't know you and your work well aren't in a position to do that. People who don't know what goes on at, for example, CERN may not be the best, though I don't actually know.  If your institution is such that there are people who know these research institutes, perhaps by having worked there, then you want to find a way to interact with them. You are a first year and they are probably senior professors so that won't be trivial.  The first task is to do well in your beginning courses and impress your professors with your potential. Spend time, as much as possible, getting close to them in office hours, seminars, and whatever else is available. If you can impress them, they see if they can introduce you to others, perhaps someone in their circle who does have experience with Leiden or CERN.  If they have research opportunities available, follow up. Not every institution will offer research openings to beginning students, so you will have to search for it. The experience will be valuable, even if it makes you realize that you'd rather be doing something else. Speaking to a faculty member whom you've already impressed might open a door.  But personal/professional relationships can make the difference in shooting for such a small target. It is the same situation as if you were trying to get accepted to one of the top universities in the world. You need more than grades, since a lot of people have good grades.  "

      "question_title": "Is it ethically justifiable to conceal a fatal conceptual flaw in a thesis to avoid an unaffordable 2-year setback if the flaw is the advisor's fault?  ",
      "question_body": "  A couple of decades ago I graduated from a Russian university with an MS in physics, and my MS thesis contained a critical flaw. In short, the thesis was about static perturbations in a certain physical system, but the system itself is unstable in the very same model, with the instability length being comparable to the characteristic size of the static perturbations in question. The whole investigation didn't make any scientific sense, because the assumed physical system can't be physically realized in the first place.  I discovered the flaw a few months before submitting my thesis. It happened rather accidentally: I wanted to formally prove that the system is stable, but the result of my calculations showed that the opposite is true. I had never heard from my supervisor, who had given me the problem for my thesis, or from his colleagues that the system may be unstable. Everyone simply did not even think about that possibility.  After I discovered the flaw, I faced the dilemma as to what to do about it.  My final choice was to tell no one, even my supervisor, and simply go on to get my MS degree, deliberately failing to mention my stability analysis and its outcome in my thesis and thereby concealing the flaw. I did so because getting my MS degree asap and moving abroad for PhD studies was my highest priority. If I had raised the issue about the flaw, I would have had to start my MS project over, if allowed at all, and spend two more years to get my MS degree.  I should have performed the stability analysis at the very beginning of my MS project, but I didn't, and it's partially a fault of my supervisor, who directed my work in a very rigid way, giving me very specific tasks and deadlines. He never told me to check whether the system is stable. The official research plan, which he and I signed, did not contain any mention of a stability analysis. It was my own initiative to try to prove that the system is stable, because I felt that this was needed to make my investigation complete. I didn't even talk to my supervisor about my idea to perform the stability analysis. After I discovered the flaw, I was sure that if I talked to my supervisor about it, he would say the whole MS project had to be canceled. A product of the Soviet era, he was ruthlessly strict in terms of norms and ethics and had little compassion towards students.  After I submitted my thesis, my supervisor insisted that I write and publish an article based on the thesis. I didn't want to do it, but I had to. After all, I needed good recommendation letters from my supervisor, so I had to obey. The article was published in a reputable American journal and was later cited about 20 times. Writing that article was the most unpleasant experience in my scientific career.  To clarify, neither my thesis nor the paper claimed that the system is stable. That the system is stable was an implicit inherent assumption of the model, and it was quite a popular model at that time. The model was invented and used for other purposes well before I even started my MS project. That is, my advisor gave me a known model that no one knew to be faulty at the time, and asked me to use it for a new purpose. As explained above, I accidentally discovered and deliberately concealed that the assumption that the system is stable is wrong and can be shown to be wrong in the framework of the very same model, so the model is inherently self-contradictory regardless of the purpose of its use.  As I expected, no one found the flaw, so I successfully got my MS degree in Russia, moved abroad, got a Western PhD degree, and some years later published an article explaining the flaw. In that article, I explicitly wrote that the model and all articles based on it are invalid science. I cited some articles, including my article based on the MS thesis, as examples of invalid science. No one published a comment in response. In private conversations, my colleagues confirmed that my conclusion about the flaw is correct. And the faulty model practically stopped being used after that.  Many years have passed since then, and I have built a solid career and have articles published in Physical Review Letters, even as the first author, but I still feel uneasy about the fact that I started my academic career with a misleading MS thesis and deliberately concealed the flaw in order to graduate smoothly.  I understand that what I did is a research misconduct, but the question I'm still struggling to find the answer to is whether my research misconduct was ethically justifiable under the circumstances. My colleagues say it was, but I'm unsure whether they are frank about it, so I really want to hear what other people have to say. I want truly impartial answers from people who do not know me. This is why I'm posting my question here.  Here are some additional details:    1. If I had not concealed the flaw, I would almost certainly have not become a scientist at all, because I could not afford two more undergraduate years in Russia. My parents didn't want to help me financially any further, so I had to get my MS degree asap and move abroad. At that time (late 1990s), living in Russia was very hard because of an economic crisis. Besides, even if I had found a way to finance the additional undergraduate years in Russia, the delay of my graduation would have harmed my chances to win the prestigious Western PhD stipend that I won.    2. Formally speaking, my MS thesis and the article based on it might be seen as not containing any flaw, because I was given a specific physical model and investigated static perturbations within the framework of that model as requested; the fact that the model is faulty is a separate, although related, thing. The message of my thesis was essentially that if we take that model and make those calculations, we get those results. It was a valid message per se. I was just an undergraduate student who had to do what the supervisor said. He gave me the model and requested certain calculations. I did them absolutely accurately and wrote up the results.    3. My MS project wasn't a significant research project anyway. It was rather a training project to learn how to do calculations and write up results. Even if the model were not faulty, the article would not have had any considerable impact. No one used the results of that project. People merely cited my paper.    4. The only harm due to me concealing the flaw was that a number of scientists continued using the same faulty model for other purposes, unsuspecting that the model is faulty. If I had told them that the model is faulty, they would have spent their research efforts for something more useful. But that would have put my own career in danger, because exposing the flaw too early might have resulted in a retraction of my MS degree and a subsequent termination of my PhD studies. I didn't want to take that risk.  **Was my research misconduct ethically justifiable under the circumstances? Or should I have reported the flaw right after I discovered it, even at the huge expense explained above? Or what should I have done after I discovered the flaw?**  ",

But, with few exceptions, such as those that literally harm other people, such errors in the past can and should be left in the past. This is especially true if you have learned from them and don't intend to repeat them. Panic is understandable and usually forgivable for such things. In some religions, for example, there is the concept of \"forgiveness\" that don't require public confessions. No one is perfect. No one always does the right thing. But if we learn from our mistakes we do can better the next time.  So, your ethics at the time are questionable, and you likely committed a violation. But, let it rest.  And, you aren't responsible for the fact that others used the same faulty model. That is on them. Had you developed the model yourself and hid its flaws (misrepresented them) then the issue would be more serious. But if it was accepted at the time then it is an artifact of scientific enquiry.  You may have an opportunity, actually, though it would be awkward to exploit it. If that model is still being used, leading to suboptimal results, you could make your misgivings known.

An overly strict supervisor who was intolerant of everyday mistakes and would likely have you start over on a new project - something that delay your plans by 2 years and put a question mark over your abilities.    2. Financial limitations imposed by your parents on any further support for your studies.  You also imply _en passant_ some other motives like wanting to move abroad for both academic and personal reasons.  If these circumstances were true **and, more importantly, complete insofar as no other facts enabling a resolution of the ethical challenge without incurring the alleged handicaps have not been omitted by you** , then you should not be so morose about it all.  But **nobody here** can assuage your doubts or feelings of guilt on the ethicality of your decision: we were not students of your supervisor in your Russian university and cannot evaluate the \"facts\" that you presented to us.  Your fellow academics - I assume this includes several from Russian universities just like you - will not bother to think too hard on your behalf. There is no point in expecting anything like objectivity from a wife or partner due to their prior emotional involvement with and investment in you.  Assuaging your own doubts and/or guilt is really one for a psychologist.  Personally I don't think this is a big deal. I think it not uncommon in academia when certain salient facts are concealed from those entitled to know where it disadvantages the informer.  Take a situation where Dr X of some department at U o Y who patiently prepares a bid for research funding for investigation of matters A, B, C and D related to a technology Z. After 2 years the bid is successful and a grant totalling say $3 million is awarded, the grant to be drawn down in $750,000 tranches as work on A, B, C and D commence.  Now suppose just after the research grant is awarded but before tranche 1 is drawn down, some PhD student doing exploratory work around study A discovers that the intended experimental approach to A is not going to work at all; in fact a much simpler approach involving available equipment will produce all the necessary data and understanding of that phenomenon. Moreover that student's work around A also indicates that studies B, C and D are likely to be much simpler and cheaper. Do you think that Dr X is going to immediately phone Professor W at the research council and ask him to cut the research grant to about $800,000 due to their recent discoveries ? Or that Dr X's Dean of Research would allow him to do so given its likely effect on how the department would be viewed for preliminary diligence on funding bids and the knock-on effect on future bids ? And that's to say nothing on the department's own operating budget and cash flow projection.  "

You can write a short erratum, outlining that there is an important caveat on the results of the thesis, and ask the library or whoever manages your MSc thesis as a public resource to ensure that the erratum is physically or electronically merged with the thesis.  This is essentially how you would fix a flaw with a publication in a physical journal, where the flaw has become apparent to you after its appearance in the public domain.  There is no logical reason why this should not work, except that you are operating within the Russian system, which can be horribly inflexible and unreasonable...  As to whether you earned the MSc, yes and no. You demonstrated sufficient ability to the satisfaction of the evaluators at the time, so yes. Still, you ought to have had the scientific courage and frankness to inform your supervisor, so no.  You were afraid to speak up at the time fearing it would engender a whole lot of trouble for you with no positive outcome for anyone at the end. I understand that.

You mention academia and I can hardly comment on that area (I was in physics).

I managed varied IT teams and if the \"Information Systems Management\" studies are studies about **how to manage IT (teams/organizations)** then they are more or less worthless.

The issue is that the English name of the program probably gives rise to different connotations than its German name, which is simply \"Wirtschaftsinformatik\". Since the majority of users of this site is unlikely to speak German, here is a brief explanation: \"Informatik\" is simply the German word for \"computer science\", and \"Wirtschaft\" is a quite generic German word which can mean various things from both business and economics.  There has been somekind of trend in Germany during the last decades to take any classical STEM program X, replace a few of the contents with anything related either to business or economics, and then call it \"Wirtschafts-X\". This often raises some issues and misunderstandings when you try to translate the name of such a program to English.  I think if you apply for a PhD in Germany or in German-speaking countries, the name \"Wirtschaftsinformatik\" is unlikely to cause you many problems as long as you have taken courses which fit the profile of the PhD that you'd like to do. If you apply in other countries and use the English notion \"Information System Management\" though, you might want to explain this a bit in your application.  But anyway, the most important thing will be which courses you take. The details of the program at TU Berlin are specified in the \"Studien- und Pr\u00fcfungsordnung\" ([link](https://www.static.tu.berlin/fileadmin/www/10000000/Studiengaenge/StuPOs/Fakultaet_IV/InformationSystemManagement_M.Sc._2017.pdf); in German). I've only looked very briefly at it, but what would make me a bit wary in your case is, for instance, that all the modules \"Machine Learning 1\", \"Machine Learning 2\", and so on, are listed in the list \"Fachstudium Wirtschaftsinformatik\", but not in the list \"Fachstudium Informatik\". This might raise the question whether these courses also treat the theoretical foundations of this topic in detail, or whether they mainly focus on applications. The table on the bottom of page 352 shows that a considerable number of credit points in the program are assigned to the fields \"Wirtschaft und Management\" and \"Wirtschaftsinformatik\", and only a few are assigned to \"Informatik\".  I don't know how much theoretical background is typically required for a PhD in artificial intelligence - but it might be worthwhile for you to briefly double-check whether the \"Wirtschaftsinformatik\" program you're interested in leaves sufficiently many opportunities for in-depth theoretical courses, or whether it focusses mainly on applications.

This suggests that some teams follow the Mathematics convention of alphabetical order and others follow the Computer Science convention which embeds information on the role of the authors in the listing of authors.  If your name comes alphabetically after at least one of your co-author's names, then you are a recognizable first author, you are the student that did the work and to whom more of the credit goes. As it is traditional in my part of Computer Science to (almost) always list students first, it is not apparent from the author listing that you had the principal idea. If not, then you are the first-listed author with no information about the contributions encoded in the list of authors. \"Ontologically\", you appear to be the first author and can call yourself this in a statement of purpose. However, I would be careful about not appearing to be bragging and instead give the same information that you gave us in your question. With other words, I would advise you to relate your success in a statement of research interests or something similar and not make a big deal about what type of author exactly you are, even though, in fact, you appear to have been the primary author.

Advice from someone more experienced can be valuable, but this professor seems to be unethical about authorship, given what you say. If they help you with the presentation of the ideas then they might be due an acknowledgement, but the standards for authorship are pretty high and especially true in maths.  If you submit to a journal, you will get some feedback. If the paper doesn't meet the expected quality standards then it will probably be quick, but not especially valuable.

There are non-critical benefits such as bringing an established name (if they are known in the field) which could open opportunities to publish in better journals. They might be able to identify well suited journals which could save you time.  However, more important is once they are in as an author, they are duty bound to ensure your paper is factual, they might also identify representation and presentation issues, find problems with the writing and so on. While theoretical work and the idea are the most important parts for a paper, you cannot publish it, if it is not represented well. You cannot expect a professor to review your paper multiple times (my top review count is 12 for a single paper) without compensation.  I was in a similar situation during the first year of my PhD. I have decided to go to the professor of a lecture with my idea that I thought I would publish in a conference. We ended up publishing in a very good journal.

Of course I know that it will be very difficult to do it at this level of study. At this level I try to prepare myself to do it. I try to study anything in detail with the proofs, and to solve some diverse and difficult problems that are often from IMO.  Since I started doing this I have noticed that I find it very difficult to combine rigorous self-study with solving very hard problems. It seems that it is better to do one thing. By this I mean either I try to study without going too deep and without knowing the details, with solving difficult problems, or I try to study in depth without trying to solve very difficult problems.  As a note, by hard exercises I mean Olympic exercises, not medium-difficult exercises like the one in \"calculus\" Spivak's book. My question is this:    * **Do you need to be good at solving difficult problems or just enough to understand everything you have studied, in order to be creative in mathematics?**    * **From your experience in scientific research, what is your advise for a student who is still trying to hone their skills to enter the field of research?**  ",

Hopefully, your program of studies will teach you how to make and formulate a valid proof. Once you get into these classes, your professors will take note of you if you have the exceptional capabilities that you ascribe to yourself by wanting to solve difficult problems. Hopefully, you can find a mentor this way. If you can, take the Linear Algebra or Algebra classes early as they will give you an introduction to how modern Mathematics works and will also give you some idea how big Mathematical knowledge now is.  Also, notice that you need mathematical creativity in addition to problem solving skills. When you do a Math Olympiad problem, you know that there is a solution and you just need to find it. Finding a handle on an unknown field requires more creativity.  Finally, if you want to do research NOW and independently of others, you need to find an area that has not been mathematized for centuries like algebraic number theory, algebraic geometry, or complex analysis of several variables. In this areas, even a genius will need a few years to understand what has already been done. It used to be relatively easy for amateurs to make contributions to Graph Theory, but I am not sure that this is the case any more. Some other topic in Combinatorics might still be fresh enough. If you are good at programming, you might want to look at some aspects in applied mathematics. Modeling biological systems probably still has some low-hanging fruits. You might also look into adjacent areas. Algorithms in Computer Science is a rather Mathematical topic, but there is more to discover there.  "

While some folks may have an inherent ability, most if not all folks benefit by focusing time on improving the practice itself independent from the need to solve a problem.    * The chances of solving a \"difficult\" problem in a reasonable time by randomly applying everything you understand at any given moment are far smaller than the chances of solving the same problem by disciplined practice in problem solving.    * \"Difficult\" problems do not continue to exist because we have too few smart folks who understand enough about everything that we can know to connect their knowledge with successful answers. Difficult problems continue to exist because the steps to connect one field of knowledge with another require both the fullest mastery in the fields and the ability to apply careful, rigorous problem solving to make the connections between the fields in a robustly acceptable manner    * At any point in life, everything you may have studied to that point could be only a subset of everything you will need to comprehend to solve a particular problem. Hence the phrase behind the practice of life-long learning.    * Creativity without discipline can fall / fail to anarchy.    * Understanding has various levels of meaning in theory and practice. Find references on the Bloom taxonomy for but one case (know, comprehend, apply, analyze, synthesize, evaluate).  So, to your questions directly ...    * Creativity in any discipline is near the top in the taxonomy of mastery. Before you get to that level, you must build your confidence in your knowledge and your ability to analyze problems on hand your knowledge. Creativity has nothing to do with just solving (difficult) problems or just understanding (comprehending) everything you have studied as an either-or choice. It is the application of both to analyze wide ranges of problems.    * Hone your ability to analyze problems that test your comprehension of the knowledge you currently have. Hone your ability to report on the results of your analysis in a way that others can also comprehend what you have done and apply your method to their own needs.  In summary, difficult problems will still exist a few years from now, and they will not be the same ones as now. As second year undergraduate student, this may not be the best time to try to find fields that have \"difficult\" problems.

By their very nature, they generally have an intended solution that is less than a page and uses nothing but high-school knowledge and some tricks that in principle can be taught to any gifted student in less than an hour or two.  Contrast this to mathematical research, which often builds upon material that takes years of university lectures to assemble all the required concepts and often involves proofs that in total extend along many pages, where the difficulty rarely consists of finding some clever trick, but mostly of splitting the problem into the right steps and sub-problems that then can each be solved using some standard methods.  This splitting into sub-problems is something you can best learn from an advisor, e.g. when writing a thesis. It is something that can rarely be put into the form of a problem, as there often is no clear right or wrong way to do it, just a better or worse one. So to learn this, it is best to have a guide, who at each step can tell you the problems with your specific approach and point you in a better direction.  Now, if you are not at the level of having an advisor yet, the thing you can study on your own is the other prerequisite mentioned, application of the standard methods. And by this I mean methods from university topics, so you will not find those in the IMO-problems but in the same medium level textbook exercises you mentioned.  \u00b9Just to make sure that I am not misunderstood, there are indeed many brilliant mathematicians who did well in the IMO. But apart from the problem of reversing causality, they studied IMO-problems when they were in high- school, which helped them by introducing them to mathematical thinking earlier than most. But at a late undergraduate level, you should already know mathematical thinking well enough.  "

I had been working on some datasets from June 2021. My supervisor could not give me time and did not reply to my calls, or texts over the medium he had instructed us to use. One day, he told us to share the research findings and materials with one of my lab mates. This meant that he'll collaborate with us on the work and he gained access to the data on what does and doesn't work well. He tweaked our work and approached our supervisor to publish it. Our supervisor also told us to implement some ideas. But that lab mate intervened saying he had implemented it. I don't know what their conversation was, but that lab mate told us that they would work separately from now on and submit after we've submitted our work somewhere. In the meanwhile, our undergraduate semester finals started, and we all took a break with the supervisor's permission. Sadly, that lab mate submitted that work to a journal without giving us any heads up and with the approval of our supervisor within the exams.  I feel betrayed and insulted because they did not give me authorship or acknowledgment that they got ideas from my experimental findings of 6+ months to quickly generate the manuscript.

If you are going to war with them, you need to be prepared.  Depending on how much your lab mate took from you, you may or may not be able to argue that he stole your work. You need the records: emails, the data that can be proven to be yours, slack (or whatever) message transcripts. If your supervisor is not on your side, or at least on the side of the truth, your mission is a lot harder. If you can't prove beyond doubt it was your data and they just tweaked it, whoever you talk to won't help.  There are a few scenarios one could think of.    1. You talk to your supervisor, ask them to add you to the author's list because it is your data and your work that got sent for publication. You setup a meeting in person, or at worse, over zoom to discuss this. You communicate clearly what you want and why. You also send an email with your argument and request. You don't need to accuse him, or your lab mate of anything at all at this stage. In fact, you should not.    2. If the supervisor answers negatively, and you have your proof that it is your data that was used in that publication, you can go to the next step: contact someone at the university who deals with academic misconduct, and you present your story and proof. At the same time, you can contact the editor of the publication, once you have seen that publication with your data on it and tell them about the issue. Normally, editors are sensitive to academic misconduct.  The second scenario is quite dangerous for you because you are making two bitter enemies exactly in your field of research, so you better have solid proof.    3. If your supervisor responds positively to your request, you let them handle your lab mate, and you stop collaborating with that person as soon as possible.    4. You can't really prove anything beyond doubt, to people from outside, but your lab mate and/or supervisor really stole from you. In this scenario, as in the second, you need to vanish from that lab and search a group who has better ethics. In this case, accusing them of misconduct is going to be detrimental for you, because they have more votes and people will believe them.  When weighing your decision, you should also take into account that people from outside the group won't believe an undergraduate student over someone with seniority. Even that your supervisor seems to ignore you, it means he might not consider you, or what you're doing important. This makes it much easier for your lab mate to appropriate your work, especially if he's a graduate student or a postdoc.  "

I would say \"only in exceptional cases\", a fundamental component of writing a review is evaluating the material, which isn't really feasible without experience.  I have noticed that quite often students reference review papers written by other students that have been published, and quite often they are not very good review papers (they miss papers than more experienced researchers may be aware of and the reviews are often uncritical). Unfortunately the students are not in a position to judge whether it is a _good_ systematic review, which rather defeats the object of having a review. I think students write reviews because they and their supervisors want to get additional value from the work the student must do in learning their field, but in general reviews are best written by people who really know the field.  Perhaps the question is to ask how much the readers would gain from the review paper. How could you be sure it was relatively complete, fair and accurate in it's evaluation?  There are exceptions, I can think of some very good reviews written by students and early-career researchers, but they are the exception rather than the rule.  The problem is that experienced researchers probably have little to gain by writing review papers...  "

Systematic (or to a lesser extent systematized) reviews are meant to be conducted in a scientifically rigorous way that removes some of the biases that might be associated with people who are highly opinionated about a particular topic as well review papers where the citations that get chosen are only reliant on that person's expertise and experience. Both traditional literature reviews and systematic reviews and meta-analyses have value, but as you are a newer reseracher who doesn't have the necessary expertise to be relied on to have an authoritative viewpoint on your topic nor the experience to know what literature to include, then by conducting a systematic review with sufficient and documented methodology, you can create the trust necessary to publish a review paper on a topic that people can respect.  I myself conducted a systematized review in a field that I was very new to and, because it fulfilled a great need in my field and had a sufficiently rigorous methodology that could be validated by others, then it has been well- received by even senior researchers in my field. Because I had to read so much of the literature on my chosen topic, I also gained a lot of knowledge and a publication in my chosen field, which I am now further backing up with other empirical and experimental research projects. The process of undergoing a systematized review has therefore been incredibly valuable to me personally while also helping my field progress in a meaningful way.  That being said, even a systematic review should not be taken on without consulting a whole host of people, including researchers familiar with your topic of interest, researchers with experience working on systematic reviews and the host of protocols they require, and with librarians with expertise in literature searches and databases. I imagine if you were to contact a senior researcher in your department, if you both have similar interests, then they could help guide you throughout the process and contribute the expertise and experience that you might be lacking.  I will warn you, however, as you are considering your options, that systematic reviews can take as much or even more time to do well than a lab experiment or field sampling or other research approach might take from the time of planning to publication, so I would also only recommend undertaking a review if you have certain limitations that prevent other methods of pursuing your particular question or if you feel fairly sure of your interest and motivation to accomplish the task (i.e., looking through hundreds or usually thousands of papers in the case of a systematic review).  This all comes from my own personal experience as an early-career researcher, and some of the other comments and answers you receive might disagree with me, but I hope that my point of view and my own experience with a very similar situation to yours can be helpful in contributing to your descision-making.

Sure! Yes! Go for it!  You should follow anything that inspires and interests you, and ignore [any comments to the contrary](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/184565/can-i-write-a- systematic-review-as-an-undergraduate-and-get-it-published-in-a- jo#comment496678_184565). Trust your judgement; there's no better way to learn about a field than to sample a wide variety of different authors' perspectives, techniques and results.  Most researcher groups can not avoid imparting at least a degree of tunnel vision since they are sort-of by definition mission-driven to publish their own unique results and perspectives.  I had an initially maddening experience with an [undergraduate independent project](https://astronomy.stackexchange.com/q/49179/7982); it was for credit and approved, and I sought out the department expert on the subject. They gave me no helpful information and a single very old reference from 20 years earlier and told me to \"muddle through\".  At first I was taken aback, but as soon as I hit the journals I had the time of my life! This is back when \"hitting the journals\" meant carting a new 50 pounds of bound volumes to your desk in the library every hour or two, lots of little ripped pieces of paper marking pages to be photocopied or read, and pages of scribbled lists of what to go look for next.  It was incredibly educational! I saw the drama of reported discoveries, corrections, alternative interpretations, theories, new theories, unfold before my eyes in a way that is almost impossible to see any other way (except for a few cases that make it to TV etc.)  > ...and get it published in a journal?  Why not!?  Yes as other answers point out, the probability is low that you can just do it yourself for say a semester, then fire it off to a journal and get an acceptance notification the first time.  But if the _process_ interests you, then even a rejection might be an interesting step!  And now that you have this large body of information, you might consider revisiting it again in a year or two, or \"marketing\" it to potential co- authors who may have excellent ideas how to improve and expand upon it.

This is because there are journals that accept all ranges of quality of work, ranging from v[ery stringent journals with less than 10% acceptance rate](https://www.nature.com/nature/for-authors/editorial-criteria-and- processes) to journals that publish almost anything submitted to them (as long as the authors pay the publication fee).  Your second question asks if you can actually produce a \"good\" review. Obviously, \"good\" is very subjective. A review that is \"good\" for student readers might not be \"good\" for highly experienced researchers, though it might be \"good\" for the majority of moderately experienced researchers who would like to learn more about the topic. I would suggest that the practical way to write a meaningfully \"good\" review is to identify a specific researcher whom you consider credibly expert on the topic and then ask them for a friendly review of your completed paper, and then recommend a journal whose selectiveness standards match the quality of the article. If this expert would be your supervisor or even coauthor for your writing of the paper, then that would greatly enhance the chance that it would be of higher quality.  "

This will certainly vary by university culture, but e.g. in my place, starting to network based upon research topics as an undergrad (assuming you mean something like pre-Bachelor) would be extremely early. Most students at that stage have just started to learn about the operational basics of their subject area.  There can of course be valuable ideas for actual research topics, but it can be hard for undergrad students to already correctly assess how interesting something is research-wise. For instance, even at the very beginning of my (CS) PhD, the ideas that I thought might be interesting were either way too technical (looking back, I now realize most were still mostly about coding something tricky rather than about any _conceptual problem_ ) or too superficial (because I didn't realize the sheer amount of existing work and the depth of analysis provided in existing solutions).  I quickly learned to get a feeling for what could be interesting in research, and always tried to convey this also to my students in seminars or BSc/MSc theses. Again, I do not know whether or not you already have a sufficient overview of what is going on in research, but your professor's response _might_ be a sign that from your questions to them, it becomes apparent you do not.  **Conclusion:** Try to get in touch with someone else (less busy) working on related topics (e.g. a TA offering a related seminar or so) and/or take part in related seminars and lectures. If you see your perspective widen indeed, contact the professor again at a later point when you also have \"more to offer\" than just requests for clarification out of what could be just a passing interest.

Also, talking about human beings, the professor would never give this answer to a peer or someone ranked higher than him.  I don't find that response appropriate or excusable. It would have taken literally 30 seconds to add to that response what the next step is. For example \"I will get back to you in 2 months\", \"I am sorry but currently I am not accepting more students\", or \"meet me in my office in 2 weeks\".  So, no one really knows what your professor means, but if I had to bet, I would bet he is not interested in you at the moment but he does not want to appear impolite or inconsiderate, so he thinks this is a better answer than answering honestly.

It could be that a better way to achieve what you want -- discuss with the professor about research -- could simply be to email them with a _short_ email and say that you are interested in their research, and ask if they would they have time to have a 30 minute - 1 hour conversation at some point.

He sent me papers to read over the course of the month, but also said he wasn't expecting me to finish them all since finals started in mid-May. He also said if I'm in town for the summer I can do research throughout this period.  I told him in May that I can stay for the summer by dorming here and would be happy to continue the research through this time, but my dorm wouldn't open until June 1st. My professor was fine with that and said we could meet starting then.  The first month or so was rather good; we would meet and discuss papers, he would give me more papers, etc. We even talked about me continuing this research in the Masters program if I applied and got in. However, around June 20th he just disappeared. I emailed the PhD Student under him and he told me the professor was out of the country, but he'd be happy to take questions. I went with him for questions for the rest of June, but he ended up leaving town prior to the start of July. I never heard anything back from the professor until July 16, who asked if we could meet at a certain date/time. I told him that due to my summer job I couldn't meet at that specific time , but I could definitely meet at another date/time.  I never got an email back, and with work and all I was too busy to follow up immediately. But I followed up the next week telling him my dorm stay would be coming to an end in a week and I was hoping we could meet before then or meet once classes resumed. He emailed me back saying he decided to cancel the research because his fall/summer semester is too busy and he doesn't think he can advise new students any more, and encouraged me to reach out to other professors for research.  I'm not sure if he cancelled research for another reason, or if he genuinely realized he doesn't have time for the research with new students. I feel for investing time and money for my summer to do research, for him to cancel without at least providing a reason or giving me some sort of advanced heads- up is really unfair. How should I proceed with this issue? There was another student doing research alongside me, I plan on emailing him to see if the same thing happened to him. I told my parents and they were pretty mad and said I should take this up with the school, but I want to at least clear this up on the ground before I do anything like this. I won't get reimbursed and I effectively wasted my summer (although I did make money through a summer job, so there's that), but should I just let this die or pursue it?  ",

However, for me it sounds strage that you think you can not continue research while he is not available for a meeting. Discussions are of course an important part of research but it is not the task of your supervisor to give you guidance with every single step. So it might be the case that your professor thinks you require too much of his own time and are not able to work alone for an extended period of time.  But this is only one option. The most probable one, though, is that he genuinely has too much to do currently due to a recent event (e.g. he just got aware of a new possibility to apply for a grant).  First, don't try to continue the research with this professor. The circumstances will not change and you will desperately try to schedule meetings with him for years. Also a formal complaint will give you nothing or is there any contract signed by the professor that you can continue your research after the summer?  Secondly, and most importantly, do not think that the summer was lost! I guess you learned a lot and you are now more experienced in reading and analyzing papers. This will help you a lot when you are going to continue a career in research. I suggest that use your gained experience and work through publications of potential supervisors first and show that you are genuinely interested in their work by sharing your ideas about their research. This should easily get you a new supervisor! Good luck with that!  "

(Undergraduates generally have limited time and skills compared to grad students and post-docs).   Given this, his position is quite reasonable: if you want to work \"for free\", fine; otherwise, this won't work out.  To change his mind, you need to reverse one of these assumptions:    * You can find a pot of money (e.g., a scholarship) and ask for his support in applying for it   * You can prove that you are really useful for the lab, and that paying you a meager salary is more cost-effective than other options. But, for most undergraduate students, this will be an impossible sale, and the professor will quickly tire of saying \"sorry, no.\"  In short: I really don't think you'll be able to convince him. Your best bet is to look for scholarships or other funding. If that doesn't work out, you should tell him honestly that while you appreciate his offer, and would certainly accept it even with a modest stipend, you simply cannot afford to travel to and live in the foreign country with no income.

Then you write about how the actual data didn't fit that scenario and that it had to be modified.  The complete picture can be valuable to a reader. As an undergraduate the analysis can also be valuable to your own understanding.  Another reason for doing it that way is to avoid a charge of fitting the hypotheses to the data, rather than validating/refuting the hypotheses with the data. Leaving out the early conception is a bit too pat.  An extreme position might even require that you revalidate a new hypothesis on new data. This would be necessary if the data was gathered under invalid assumptions driven by the original hypothesis. But for undergraduate research that is likely overkill. But it might be needed in some studies that have policy implications or implications about health and such.

The solutions to disagreements depend a lot on the balance of power and on the ego of the parties involved and a lot less on who has the best idea. If you want to get your way, you need to take that into account.  If you are a supervisor, you can just force your way. If you are not in charge, you need to discuss with your supervisor, until the correct solution becomes clear to them, too, assuming you know what is that solution.  Generally, it's a bad idea to frame things as your way vs their way. Even if you can force the other person to adopt your approach, you still didn't convince them. Even if you can prove with references and examples that your approach is a lot better, you still need to make them admit to themselves that your way is better then theirs. That's where ego comes into play. Sometimes, more senior people won't be able to accept a sound argument simply because it comes from someone they perceive as their juniors. It also goes the other way around. The one who has the sound solution won't budge and won't explain why because their colleague is \"an idiot\".  Not knowing your supervisor, it is unlikely I can give you a very useful advise on how to handle the disagreements with them. You need to talk to them a lot and present data. You might even need to try things their way and your way and show them the results. It might be sufficient to write everything in a short an clear email.  But, you should be mindful of the principles: be clear and concise, be respectful, don't start with the premise that you know better, and be open yourself to changing your mind in case your supervisor seems to have useful ideas.

Here's my answers to questions given my experiences mentoring over 3 summers over the past 7 years:  > In general, what does success look like in an undergraduate research > project?  For the students, learning about research through doing research. I have had students discover they want to go to grad school. I have also had students learn they do not want to go to grad school. Both outcomes are successes because they positively shaped the students' lives.  An added bonus is that I have had 2 student first-authored papers from their projects. However, the mentorship was my greatest personal success.  > The timespan is relatively short (6-8 weeks), and I'll have to learn and > apply my knowledge quickly. So what does success mean?  Be organized. Plan out a schedule before you start. We treated our REU like a mini-biology master's program for 10 weeks.    * We spend about 2 weeks in a coding and math/stats/biology boot camp. This ensures all students have the skills they need.   * We then gave the students a focused project, usually in groups of 2-3. For some students, the project would take all summer. But, they would have something to present at future meetings. These projects could be simple questions we had about data or existing models. Or, they might be recreating an existing paper. We selected projects given our (the mentors' interests) that also naturally lent themselves to bigger questions. For stronger students, these projects would springboard into bigger questions they would discover on their own.   * We would spend the last 2 weeks winding down. The students would create a poster of their work. This gives them something to share at their home university. We also would send students to a national meeting to present after the REU. Also, we would do a de-brief with the student.  Throughout the REU, we would have guest speakers talk about the softer sides of science and research. For example, we have regular speakers on careers in science and also people talking about how they got their jobs.  We also ensured our REU students' research was impactful and novel because we applied the models to new systems used by managers. For example, we would have the students work on problems US Fish and Wildlife Service biologists could use the results from for their management. Thus, even if the math and statistics were not new, the biological application were novel and impactful because agency biologists could use the results for decision making.  > How can I ensure that measurable achievements come out of such a project? > What kinds of measurable achievements are there to aim for?  Look at the paper I shared. My collaborators did formal pre- and post-REU assessments.

It would be a good idea to attempt to estimate computational requirements to the best of your ability, by looking at relevant literature that you base your ideas on. If the costs are likely to be extremely high (as an extreme example, take the cost of training GPT-3), you could shelve the idea and think of something else.  However, no matter how carefully you go through this, it is always possible to miss something vital. Particularly, since you are undergraduate and it sounds like you are not yet very experienced in this field, you may miss factors to consider that are obvious to your professor. This is completely fine: you learn by working on projects, and it is the role of the supervisor to guide you through it. As long as you make a good faith effort and are enthusiastic to learn, it is very unlikely that they'll think you are an \"idiot\" because of this.  So, it would be a good idea to prepare well, but not wait too long to approach the professor. Their inputs can prevent you from wasting time on infeasible ideas, and also help improve your proposal. If they consider the idea feasible and interesting and accept your project, they would very likely cover most of the costs too by providing access to their lab's resources, so external funding, while welcome, may not be necessary.  Referring to your second question: yes, you can certainly discuss other ideas and ask for suggestions, or offer to join an existing project. It is unlikely to be unusual for professors to provide complete project ideas at the undergraduate level.  "

Please note, it is usually very competitive to get selected. Earlier, they used to select students based on [NPTEL](https://nptel.ac.in) exam results. I remember reading somewhere that you could also email the respective professor and ask if he/she is willing to assign an intern. So, it is best to email the professor. He/she might invite you to work with him/her during Summer/Winter vacation.    * Sometimes, I see professors of electronics asking undergrads to write codes. So, you can understand that they would let you do something which perhaps they might not be very comfortable with (reasons being, new languages, new areas, etc). I remember a friend of mine was assisting a professor by writing python codes for some machine learning experiment. Most of the Physics/Electronics professors in India above 50s are comfortable with FORTRAN, while the younger generation learns Python right at high school.    * Usually, you would not see much research in a normal college offering undergraduate degrees. They wouldn't have the equipment, etc. They go to a university for those.  So, if you are willing to contribute to research the best thing would be to:    * talk/email professors from your areas of interest. If you are in a reputed institute like in one of the IITs, IISc, etc. it becomes easier and it's best to try to get into one of such institutes.  "

Can you get involved in initial years? Yes and no. It's difficult to answer without knowing if your uni is decent w.r.t to the world or just the country. I study at IIT Delhi (Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi) and I'll tell you my experience:    * Yes, you can ask professors to get involved in research in your initial undergrad years. You'll most probably not have the required background, but there are professors willing to help you learn and develop and/or explore interest(s). You'll not contribute significantly but it'll help you start learning. To reach to the level of actually publishing something, it'll happen later in undergrad. A freshman is just getting started will college and sophomore with their major. It is after that that you'll start taking advanced courses - but who's stopping anyone from learning!    * For summer and winters, many students apply for research opportunities in other institutes and universities for research interns in summer. A lot of people from the top IITs and/or IISc also go to research interns abroad. At IITD, we also have institute programmes to do projects in summer. A lot of information about such programmes is shared over mailing lists or informed by your seniors in college. Most of the research opportunities are obtained by emailing. Even for research programmes, a better path is emailing someone from the research team first - unless the guidelines state otherwise.    * If you're not in IIT/IISc/IISER, you can mail professors from these institutes to get involved with them. However again, that requires you to show more dedication since there are already students from that institute itself showing interest. Very few to none have dedicated research programmes for external students.    * Most professors will deny, some will be open to short projects while some might ask you to dedicate longer times. Usually the shorter projects do not provide a new learning curve, so research projects are usually the latter ones. Landing an opportunity depends on how you approach professors and show interest. They do not need you, you need them; show interest, be willing to learn.  In conclusion,    * Can you have research experience in your undergrad in India? Yes.    * In initial years? Depends on you and under whom you apply.    * Are researches necessarily done by college professors or there are other groups of researchers who provide opportunities out of school? Not all researchers are professors but most of such opportunities are available to grad students so your best bet is first reaching out to professors in or outside your university since they're more open to working with students.

You might get slightly better response if your advisor sends the mail on your behalf as a request from a faculty member is a bit harder to ignore.  However, make sure you have the appropriate sign-off from the local ethical committee before you complete your design, since you are dealing with human subjects. There will be privacy and other concerns.  The big problem, as I see it, is that you won't be able to conclude much from such a study as it will be very difficult to assure that you have a random sample of the population of study. You can get anecdotal evidence, but your sample will be self selected, which leads to the issue of likely bias that is hard to measure.  You might be able to examine extreme views from such a study. My (somewhat cloudy) crystal ball suggests that the extremely pleased and the extremely dissatisfied are more likely to submit to an interview than the \"typical\" faculty member.  Some things are very hard to study if you want any validity at all. And note, also, that for issues like this the population changes every day, since policies are in general flux. And don't neglect the fact that \"general\" satisfaction with work-life balance might be quite different in, say, philosophy and pharmacology.  "

        "answer_body": "  You say you don't really know a lot of academia. I think what you need to learn about it for this situation is quite simple -- good academic practices are founded on **good communication**. It may be that the PhD candidate you are working with is not particularly good at it, which is even more of a reason for you to lead by example (of good communication) in this case.  As far as I understand, you have not yet discussed the possible paper resulting from this research with your PI. **Take initiative in discussing this with your PI.** Some advice for this discussion:    * Come prepared with facts, not opinions.  So _\" I designed experiments X Y and Z and contributed to the analysis by performing A B and C\"_ is good, but _\" I became very independent\"_ is an opinion which you'd like your PI to reach based on the facts you present, and not something to say.    * Especially if you're unsure about academic practices, phrase things as questions.  Conventions on author order [differ from field to field](https://academia.stackexchange.com/q/2467/4249) \\-- a lot. But a practice that is/should be universally encouraged is _discussing it before work on the paper has started_. So after presenting your contributions _to date_ , ask about the authorship conventions and discuss your place (and the meaning of your place) in that list.    * Remember that the work is not done -- writing is a skill.  This is the key. While discussing the authorship, ask _what should be your contributions going forward_ , related to the write-up. While it seems like you have done a substantial amount of work to date, maybe your PhD student co- author can make up for some of it in the writing phase.    * Be open to the possibility that you are not correctly interpreting your contributions so far.  Being talked over is certainly not nice, as is somebody misrepresenting your work as theirs (in fact, that is called plagiarism, but that's a whole other discussion). But I still prefer to assume good intentions (while still being careful) from other people. This is why preparing for this meeting with facts about your specific contributions will help.  However, I don't know from your question whether this PhD student had separate meetings with the PI about the project. Did they contribute to conceptualising the research direction, or experiment design (maybe even before you joined?). So be prepared to listen and change your opinion about your relative contributions if new facts are presented.  Finally, there is a possibility that you take initiative, initiate good communication, however both your PI and your PhD co-author are not cooperating. Sadly, even if you deserve first authorship, while discussing it is certainly worth it, entering an argument over it isn't. Any undergrad publication is already a huge boost to your profile, regardless of where you are in the author list -- and if you can elaborate on your contributions when asked, that's how you can really shine. If _any_ authorship is on the table rather than _first authorship_ , and you do not believe the discussion went well (i.e. no facts were presented to convince you the other person was the primary contributor), take what you can get and look to move away from this PI in the future.

They rely on field experts \"testing\" a paper before it is published. An academic paper offers a hypothesis with supporting evidence. So, how does a researcher identify appropriate evidence? A paper published earlier is usually part of that evidence. Selection requires testing a number of sub-questions. The provenance of the author, do they have a track record of publications in the research field is one of those questions. The presumption is that an author who has published in the field for twenty years has \"more expertise\" than a researcher publishing their first paper. Initial paper research is essential to test that the hypothesis is unanswered. And, this will identify the established field experts. Initially, the student is named last, they graduate, supervise their own students and rise to second name. When they hold a professorial chair, theirs is the first name. A short time span for this process suggests growing respect for their expertise. It is an effective system that reduces risk for student, department/laboratory, providers of research grants, the academic community at large.  "

Nobody expects your first papers to represent the best work of your career. If you are early in your career (e.g. undergrad or grad student), it is much better to have some papers on your CV, whatever their quality, instead of none. And if you are later in your career, nobody will pay much attention to your earliest work. You might be judged based on your best papers, or your latest papers, or your total number of papers, but not on your first papers.  As to your enumerated concerns:  (A) There's nothing wrong with that. If you do any amount of collaboration in your career (and you should), you will be a coauthor on papers where the main idea came from someone else. That's fine, as long as there are also some where the main ideas are yours. (If you have great ideas, wouldn't you want other talented people to be willing to help bring them to completion? So you should be willing to do likewise, within reason.)  (B) Nobody writes exclusively great papers; every CV has papers that are not so good. Good papers get noticed, not-so-good papers (unless they are plagiarized or egregiously substandard) just get ignored. Mediocre papers don't directly hurt you, they simply don't help you. So don't worry about having written papers that aren't great.  (C) As above, the start of your publication history is not something that people care about, so there's no particular advantage in going to great lengths to ensure that your first (acknowledged) publication is super awesome. If you write that super awesome paper eventually, it will overshadow the others, and if you don't, at least you'll still have something to show.  Note also that a common convention on a CV is to list papers in _reverse_ chronological order: newest papers first, and earliest papers at the end, where nobody is likely to pay them much attention.

As part of a masters courses in my uni, students have a rather long project to do (each student has its own project). This project is divided in two parts: an analysis part (short, they need to understand their project and state how they want to achieve it) and an experimentation part (the main part of the project, they need to achieve as much as they can). Each part is evaluated with a report and a small defence.  In this context, I have a student working on a project I submitted. The first part of the project has now ended and I have the following problems:    * the student lied to me on the submission date for the report   * they did not submit anything   * they did not come to their defence  What I did as an advisor:    * during the project: took several hours to explain the project and provided help to prepare the experiments (they are not done right now)   * offered my help for writing the report (asked for the student to send drafts regularly and to ask about anything unclear, never received any draft)   * I was present at the defence to help them if they could not answer questions  What happened then:    * they scored the worst marked for the first part of the project   * I did not received any explanation nor excuses   * I can decide whether I accept that they continue the project or not  So my question is: what do you advise in such context?  Here I listed a few options:    * let them do the rest of the project and help them with the experimentations (note that at this point I do not expect any workable result anymore, but maybe they will work better than on the first part)   * forbid the student to finish the project (it is likely that they won't be able to validate the project anyway due to their mark at the first evaluation, and I will have more time for my research, perhaps doing their project by myself)   * ask the student to submit the report before deciding (we will loose some time on the rest of the project, but it was explicitly asked to submit this report and I could make sure that they understood what they need to do).

On the converse though, whatever you do, be careful in how you do it and how you present it to the student. Right now you know only part of the story.

And failing such an important class and possibly their whole degree might be what convinces a clinically depressive student to do something irreversible. It's not your job to deal with this, but if you suspect something, your university might offer some psychological student counseling you could involve as well.  "

Yet I haven't seen many such examples in mathematics.  I'm wondering if it will be appropriate to have a statement of contributions in a paper (algebraic geometry + some applications) that states the contribution of a coauthor who is my undergraduate student. If yes, will it be strange if the statement only explain the contribution of this student coauthor but not other coauthors?  The intended purpose for such a statement is twofold:    1. To highlight the real (and nontrivial) contribution of an undergraduate student which may potentially be helpful for this student's career.   2. To avoid opposition from coauthors who may question listing a student as an author. (EDIT: To avoid opposition from coauthors who may question the actual amount of contribution)  EDIT: One crucial detail was left as it was somewhat subjective. The student's contribution is small but nontrivial in my opinion. It is only a nice-to-have result. This paper can live without it. But I believe it adds some depth to this paper. So the necessity of this student's contribution is debatable. I'd hope to preemptively eliminate this debate --- why argue with someone you'll work with for a long time.  ",

But author or contributors to the publication should present new and valuable scientific things to the future readers of their paper. I can classify these _new things_ in a list bellow:    1. An old method applied to solve a new problem;   2. A new method applied to solve an old and a solved problem;   3. A comparison of different old or new methods to solve a problem and discuss their accuracy or efficiency in solving problems by comparing their results;   4. A review on different methods to solve problems.  As you can see, there is no need to always have new results in the papers, but papers should have something new for their readers. Of course if your reader wants to read about those two existing methods, he can simply find and read the original papers instead of your publications.  An author may find a newer method to solve a solved old problem but in a more efficient way. Or he may find a very hard solution which may not be that much accurate, but it _is_ a unique and new approach to solve the problem.  In your researches of applying those old methods, probably you did some programming and soft computing or applied some computational methods which may be unique and of value to be published in form of a research paper.  In your case, the only thing that comes to my mind is that you may consult the professor whom you worked with to discuss whether your results are publishable or not. You have some choices of course:    1. Write a comparing paper on the methods you applied and discuss their accuracies by comparing their results. You may also present the computer programming you did during your research. Also, you can discuss the amount of time each method consumes for reaching same results accessed by applying either of methods. You may also do some statistical calculations on the data you have as a result of those existing methods, which may also be something of value to the readers in your field.    2. Work some more in the field of the researches you did during your undergraduate years and find some more results and data or find a newer method and publish your whole research in form of a paper.  > [M]y question is that whether it would be possible to publish such kind of > research project in form of a formal paper or not[?]  If your manuscript is well processed and contains valuable information to be published, it has some chances to be published in a journal or presented in a conference.  But please note that not every paper is valuable for every journal. Some journals are very high reputable and have high levels of impact factors. So, please evaluate your paper and submit it to a journal that publishes the same level of papers as your own paper. A very low quality paper may not always have the chance to be published in a well known and high reputable journal.  Of course anyone may submit his manuscript to a journal or conference, but submitting a paper does not really mean that their editors and reviewers will accept it for publication.  > [W]ould it affect in a positive way my scientific \"career\", since I would be > able to say that I started publishing studies early than the usual (I mean, > my knowledge tells me that publish stuff during undergrad means \"early\")?  Having publications based on your research activities in the undergraduate years is a valuable point in a person's scientific CV, but please note that for applying to some scientific careers, you should have higher levels of research. As an instance, for one applying to a post-doc position, having a good PhD level dissertation and probably one or two publications (depending on the applicant's field) is of course of more value than his early undergraduate level research.  If you are seeking a scientific career after obtaining your undergraduate degree; your research activities may be of value, but it hugely depends on the taste of your employer and their expectations.  As a general answer to this part of your question, having some researches during your undergraduate years is a good point in your CV and will not hurt your academic background. But this is not all for a potential applicant to a scientific career; as you may have some skills, good letters of recommendations, good grades, etc. These are important too.  > Moreover, would it be a positive fact to have papers publicized, even if > they don't have new results or anything unpublished?  I think that it would be positive to have a publication out of your undergraduate researches, as it may show that you are a potential and enthusiastic researcher and you are so encouraged in doing research.  But answering to whether it is positive or not to publish such results, hugely depends on your manuscript. If you simply copy and paste existing results without any new activities, seems not a positive activity to me. I prefer to read the original papers not a copy of them in a newer paper. If you do something new, even a very small thing is valuable and of course sounds so positive.  (Just joking but I call a person who just published existing results without anything new to read in his paper a professional copy-paster, not a researcher!)  "

      "question_body": "  After completing my Phd in an area in pure Maths and going back to my country, I got a job as a math lecturer at a university, where maths is not the main subject for students there. Maths is like school swimming subject that every student at my university has to learn before moving on to other subjects.  I usually teach 35 hours/week. That sounds a bit crazy for many people, but it is normal here when you are living in a small country with a big population. I love doing reaseach. Spending time quitely, reading papers of other mathematicians, taking note, enjoying the findings, these were what I used to have during my Phd in support from a scholarship.  The problem is that, I am now teaching students who are really unmotivated. It is understandable because maths is not their main concern. Even though Maths here is quite basic, for example calculus or linear algebra, it seems that it is a big deal for them. The students always feel like they are forced to learn unnecessary, difficult stuff. So their reaction is to almost ignore the subject. They go to class, sleep or talk, and let whatever happens to their exams for the future. It is quite stressful to teach these students. I admit that many maths stuff like, surface integrals or Green formula, are really hard to teach for this kind of students. Because they don't like to hear or know how should a theorem be true. On the other hand, if you just tell them that well! this is a theorem, let's imagine it was true and use it. Then the situation isn't better either. Of course, I am not in a position to determine what I have to teach, what not. All the given content in a subject should be taught for students during the course.  These things are bothering me and take me a lot of time. The students may complain if they don't like me. So I should focus on my teaching duty. However, it is killing me since I cannot have time for my reserach. At the end of the day, I am exhausted and feel guity because I have done nothing.  My question: do we have any way or tricks to teach unmotivated students to make them feel easy, feel smart, so they don't complain, but in the same time we don't spend total energy for the teaching? If I run my work properly, I still have time and mental energy for my reaseach.  Any suggestions, even small, would extremely be appreciated.  ",

I went to a professor at my university with a novel idea. I was able to provide good answers to their questions and they are willing to conduct the experiment with me. This would likely take the form of a \"Research Problems\" 1 to 3 credit course this semester, and next semester, and a few grants, including possibly a grant to work over the summer on the project (they would be listed as a sponsor).  I am wondering about credit, I came up with the idea, and I would mostly be focusing on this (and maybe one other project at a time) for the next year (I am planning to take less classes to focus on it, and even graduate even later). It would probably be less of an \"assistant\" role. I am wondering about how credit would be shared or what my professor might expect. I know often the first name on the paper matters a lot, would the professor expect to put their name first? If so, if I take on the role I expect too, would it be interpreted that I was an undergraduate assistant of some sort that sort of helped? I just don't want to lose credit/recognition for the idea and be recognized for the work I am planning to do (as a foundation on which to submit future articles -- possibly without an institution or company attached).  I am hoping to maybe become an independent researcher, and I want to start building my reputation with this.  Thank you  EDIT:  I think I may have misunderstood the term \"PI\" a bit.

I proposed the idea I had together with my references on him and fortunately he agreed to supervise my project, although it doesn't quite fall under his research interests and expertise(half of the project).  It looks like the project-thesis is going to lead in one or more publications. At one of our meetings he offered me a PhD position after I graduate, after seeing I got some potential, I assume.  Unfortunately I acknowledge myself as a bad student, in the sense of the relationship between the professor and the student. The student is supposed to listen to the professor's points and suggestions and ask for his recommendations-corrections etc.  I'm a bad listener, and quite impulsive, I have to admit. After he goes through my writings during the meeting and asks questions trying to understand I am constantly interrupting in order to explain myself.  Most of the time I know the material pretty well(I always provide a list of references at each meeting related to the work I've done the days before). I understand this may be perceived as me being arrogant and selfish. However this happens completely spontaneously as an attempt of defence; (I've had a professor in the past constantly asking questions at me until I don't have a complete reply or until it's wrong. Then he would just brag I have no idea what I'm taking about.)  By no means I want to harm my relationship with my supervisor. I am certain a change of my behavior is needed, but have no idea how to proceed.  ",

First, when the professor gives you feedback, focus on _listening_ to all of it before you even think about replying. Then, before you respond, ask yourself:    1. Is it really worth correcting the other person? Will either of you care about this conversation tomorrow?    2. Is the feedback _entirely_ wrong? For example, I submit an article to a journal, and I'll get a comment back from the reviewer saying that I didn't talk about X. But I did talk about X! Then it occurs to me that if the reviewer missed it, maybe another reader might miss it, so it might be worth beefing up what I wrote about X, or making it clearer, or something like that.  If the answer to both questions is yes, _take a deep breath_ (to give yourself one last chance to think it over), and then explain your side of things.  "

A person's competency in their chosen subject has nothing to do with how they choose to manage their stress. Let me use a concrete example: [Alexei Starobinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexei_Starobinsky) is a famous physicist who has made many contributions to the field of cosmology. However, he almost never attends conferences because he speaks with a stammer and finds giving talks and interacting with others verbally to be very stressful. This does not diminish his contributions to the field in any way.  Furthermore, someone may actually work more effectively when they have taken steps to look after their health -- for example, choosing to work from home during a pandemic -- than if they are forced to work in stressful conditions. And a situation which may be fun or relaxing for one person may be very stressful for another. It's not up to us to debate other people's personal boundaries.  Lastly, why do you think it's impossible to \"produce a publishable report\" while staying at home? The vast majority of researchers managed to do exactly that over the past two years.  > Am I being too harsh? If you get stressed easily, you will never improve if > you always run away from it.  I agree that to increase one's comfort zone one has to step outside it from time to time. But again, it's not up to us to force another person to do this. They have to come to this realisation on their own and take their own steps. For example, perhaps the person you are talking about _is_ already working to improve, perhaps by having a friend over to their house or meeting a single person outside. Maybe in a few months they will be comfortable having a group meeting in person. Or maybe they won't be. Either way, as Buffy says, you should try to be supportive rather than coercive.  "

To the best extent possible, the assessement should base its grade on ability in those skills/items of knowledge alone. In pedogogical terms, we call this \"constructive alignment\".  A person with either a mental health issue or simply a personality trait that makes this difficult may get lower grades, or even fail, for reasons that are related to the nature of the assessment, rather than any lack of ability at what is supposed to be being assessed.  So, if the aim of the assessment to to assess an indeviduals ability to research things from the literature, or write reports, then to base a grade on their ability to interact face to face is clearly not properly following the precinciples of constructive alignment.  Now, if an ability to work with a face to face team is an explicit stated goal of the course, then it is fair to assess this. There are situations where this is appropriate. But more often group excercises are set for other reasons, like they encourage active rather than passive leanring, they encourage students to interact with primary sources/research, and they are much less work to grade for the professor ;). In these situations, it is not fair to grade on the basis of ability to interact.  This is no different to allowing dyspraxic people to type exam answers, blind people to use screen readers, and providing transcripts/subtitles to deaf people. What one person calls \"shyness\" could be a debilitating social axiety disorder (diagnosed or undiagnosed), and the idea that such people can just \"get over it\" is simplistic.  "

I also infer that you haven't read many papers in the field, since if you did, you would have some idea about how they are written and where they are published.  It may sound harsh, but if this is indeed the case, it is very likely that your algorithm is not new, or flawed, or worse than the state-of-the-art. It is not _necessarily_ the case, but given the odds, the first thing you should do is mentally prepare for this.  Then, you should try and read as many publications in the area of your work and related ones, to try to find out whether what you did is new and worthy, trying to be impartial and fully prepared to learn that it is not. Think of it this way: if you do write a paper, it will need an introductory section explaining what's the state of art and how you improve no it, convincing enough for the editors and the referee. So this is a work you will need to do anyway.  On 2-3, it's perfectly appropriate to try and ask people for help, but I would not expect a lot out of it. For people you don't know and outside your university, the best you can hope for is to get answers to pointed questions about their area of expertise. People in your department are also unlikely to be interested if you just ask them \"I have an idea outside your area, can you teach me how to write a paper out of it.\" They might know someone who knows the subject and re-address your questions to them, or to ask them to generally evaluate the idea, or tip you off which conference/journal to submit the paper to.  But the thing is, to efficiently ask people for help, you would need to communicate them what you did, and the only way to do it is to already have some manuscript written up.  "

[Connecticut's laws define various crimes](https://www.criminaldefenselawyer.com/resources/criminal- defense/felony-offense/connecticut-felony-class.htm) which can be of different classes (A\u2013D, unclassified). Class A crimes constitute the more serious types of crimes and carry longer sentences and large fines, while Class D crimes are the least serious kind. For example, Class A felonies can lead to a life sentence, while Class D felonies can lead to a small fine. However, **no matter what class** does the crime belongs, **it is still a crime**.  Similarly, **data should never be falsified**. However, the seriousness of the offense and the consequences (in case, it is discovered) would differ. The impact and, maybe even more importantly, _mens rea_ (guilty mind) of the falsification from a first-year B.Sc. student is different from an established researcher.  Moreover, one could argue that more serious crimes usually originate from less serious ones (discovered or undiscovered); therefore, it is extremely important to have students educated about the Code of Honor and the importance of research\\educational integrity as early as possible.  To summarize, falsification of data is always really-really bad. The severity of the consequences might vary. But, as it is with **any** criminal record, it makes it very hard to overcome this event in the future, potentially closing some roads forever.

What is the purpose of the assignment? Often, assignments are meant to teach as well as to assess; if this assignment had your team performing interviews with random people (presumably after the professor got IRB approval for that particular piece of assessment), then you have to ask yourself why the professor was intending for you to do so. Was teaching surveying and interview skills the primary part of the assessment, or was it a secondary part, with the primary thrust of the assessment based around your analysis of the data you gathered?  Assuming that my university's academic dishonesty policy didn't have explicit instructions on how to handle this (in which case I would, of course, follow them), then I think that my response as an instructor would vary depending on the purpose of the assignment. If the primary purpose of the assignment was to teach and/or assess the students' interview or survey skills, they'd just get a flat 0 for the assignment, because they haven't done any actual surveying. If the surveying was just a secondary part of the assignment, I'd give them a 0 for the part of the assignment that involved the survey - and I'd probably rethink including a survey section on that assignment when I ran the unit again the next year, and would likely just give the students data to analyze.

If your school doesn't have a policy requiring that you report misconduct, it's a more personal question. When do _you_ think you have an ethical duty to report wrongdoing?

      "question_body": "  I am an undergraduate student, and recently I was introduced a PhD student in my university's math department.  In a brief interaction with him, he mentioned that he was doing work in Differential Topology, an area which I happen to be self-studying at the moment. I asked him about his research problem, and mentioned what I was self- studying, and he offered me an opportunity to work with his PhD advisor (a former professor of mine), and himself, and stated that they were looking to publish a paper in mid 2018, and I could possibly be listed as a co-author.  He has yet to run the idea past my former professor, but he has stated that my former professor would be all on board with the idea. My former professor likely does not know or remember me, we only had one brief interaction during a class on Discrete Mathematics (coincidentally the interaction was about Differential Topology and some other Differential Geometric stuff, because he saw me reading a book on it before class commenced).  However, my university has no official undergraduate research program, so everything (i.e. any research conducted) will likely be done on an informal basis. My main question is this, how can I protect the work that I do on a project like this? What measures can I take to ensure that whatever work I do is credited, if the paper containing my work is published?  Firstly it should be noted, that regardless of whether or not my work will be recognized on the paper (if any contributions to the paper are made by my part) I still intend to take this opportunity and work with the PhD student and my former professor, mainly as it will be a good learning experience for me on how to properly do research, the possibility of being listed as a co- author is just an added bonus.  Also I'm well aware, that it's probable that I may not make any contribution at all, however I am asking this question in the event that I do contribute some work towards the paper.  If it's of any importance, I have a good relationship, and am somewhat well known by other faculty members (Topologists) in my universities' math department, as they have previously allowed me attend lectures for their courses which are only reserved for students in years above me.

Except for very large projects, essentially all research collaboration is done \"on an informal basis\". You've seen that being on a formal undergraduate research programme and being a PhD student both give some sort of formal basis to a research collaboration and you've incorrectly generalized. For example, if two professors in your department are chatting over coffee and decide to collaborate on something, there is no formal programme that either one is a part of.  Authorship of research papers isn't decided by looking at the staff list of some formal collaboration: it is decided who contributed intellectually to the work. If you, the PhD student and the professor work together on something and that work leads to a paper, you should all be co-authors of that paper. The reason that PhD students' advisors are very often co-authors of papers is that the advisor very often contributes intellectually to their student's work, and not because of the existence of the formal student-advisor relationship.  > My main question is this, how can I protect the work that I do on a project > like this?

Unlike other answers, I'll mention that it is not unheard of for higher-ups to fail to credit more junior collaborators. So while you have no reason to believe this will happen in your case, some relatively-benign protective measure may be in order.  I would suggest one (or more) of the following:    * Using some relevant on-line collaboration tool - such as a git/mercurial repository for paper drafts, or a Dropbox/Box.com/OwnCloud shared folder through which you exchange files - preferably one which they cannot delete on their own.   * A bit of \"wordsmithing\" in some of your email exchanges with them so that whoever reads the email exchange understands that either some of the work is assigned to you, or some of the results were obtained by you. Things like doing a bit of planning or roadmapping over email typically achieve this effect without sounding off.   * Engineering one or more occasions in which you and one of the other two are discussing your joint work in the presence of a third party with closer/better relations to you than to them.  The first two you could probably do regardless of wanting to protect yourself; the third one involves at most a bit of bragging, which is understandable for an undergrad and can be minimized.  Each of these reduces the degree of plausible deniability in a theoretical argument about credit, and even more importantly, discourages the very inclination your senior collaborators may have to ignore your contribution.  * * *  A side-note: There could be three scenarios here regarding the extent of your contribution to such work.    1. Sufficient to merit co-authorship   2. Sufficient to merit a \"crediting mention\" (\"The authors wish to thank Ms. Jane Smith for useful comments regarding frobnicating the bar\").   3. Less sufficient  ... and with you being an undergrad it will be hard for you to tell the difference between these three. So if you feel you're being under-credited, consult other people first, discreetly, for their opinion on this.  Good luck and I hope you don't need any of this advice!  "

      "question_body": "  I am a first year BSc student in pure mathematics. I like to continue my PhD studies in Sweden, directly after BSc or otherwise after having MSc. Unfortunately, not only free education for international MSc students has been stopped several years ago but also the living cost in Sweden is very very high. Only leaves PhD studies as a final choice as they pay for tuition fees and living expenditures.  I have heard that the only way to get a PhD admission (with scholarship) in a some university in Sweden is to do MSc in some Sweden university so that the professors will 'know' you; in other words, contrary to US or Canada, they prefer to know students in their classes than reading about them from the recommendation letters sent from other countries.  A friend of mine, planted this wishful idea in my mind that if I accomplish (much?) more in my BSc time that PhD students do required for their graduation (i.e. good published papers), along with other things [recommendation letters, GPA, etc] so it may make me more appealing candidate than a person whose professor knows him/her personally. [Q.1] Is this true? And if so, [Q.2] how much 'better' than minimum-required-papers-to-be-published-for-a-PhD-to-be- graduated I need to do? Is there any measure for 'better' papers at all and what are they?  PS I am sure a person who solves Riemann H, attaining an academic position let alone PhD is trivial; so obviously sky is the limit. I am wondering about the _minimum_ of \"impressive results\" in research (capability to be a productive researcher) one needs to do for a guaranteed PhD position which should be achievable during 3-4 years time that I have.

        "answer_body": "  You heard wrong. You 1) don't need to know Swedish professors personally to be admitted (although it helps of course), and 2) you don't need to have achieved more than what PhD students need to graduate. About #1, it's the same as elsewhere. If you know the professor personally - and there are ways to do this other than studying in Sweden, you can for example email them or speak to them at conferences - then that's good because they have firsthand knowledge of you. For the same reason if your recommendation letters are written by people who the professor knows personally, that's also helpful. But you don't _have_ to have these personal contacts, and having them doesn't guarantee admission; they're only helpful. As for #2, if it is ever true, you'd be an exceptionally qualified applicant.  Finally about the PS: applicants with a BS degree typically have taken a lot of courses, and have some research experience. That could for example include a final-year project (also known as an Honours project in some places), summer research programs, or various internships. If these leads to published papers then so much the better, although it often does not. What really matters out of these projects is that you've worked directly with a more senior academic who'll become one of your recommendation letter writers. Impress her, and you'll have a much stronger application.  "

It is however possible to do insightful, publishable research, which would be my first time.  Doing publishable research would take a lot of time. Because there is a finite amount of hours in a day and week etc., I see three options:    * Distribute my time evenly, and get good exam and project grades.   * Prioritize exams (I expect my score to be about 80-90%) over the project.   * Try and do reasonably well on exams (score about 70%), but put everything I've got into the project.  I think I am knowledgeable in the area and I'll be able to contribute and create publishable research and write a paper if I prioritise it.  If I would like to go and do a PhD and then become a professor, I think a publication is worth more than ridiculously high grades. Assuming I won't drop below 70%average upon graduation; should I marginalise the exams?  ",

Also, don't assume that the two sides are fully independent. A reasonably broad background education can be useful when doing research. It provides you with a better set of tools with which to approach your problem (or at least lets you know that such tools are likely to exist).

Even more than succeeding, you are banking on this research being sufficiently interesting and impactful, that grad school committees are so impressed that they overlook your senior grades. Maybe you could justify lower grades if you were **sure** you could get a high impact publication out of your research, but I doubt you can be sure of this. I would set the minimum bar for yourself at getting good grades, and completing the senior project at the level that is done by most students.

It really depends on which you value more highly, and we can't tell you what to value.  That said, we can tell you what the cost to your reputation might result in: a supervisor who may be unwilling to write a reference for you when you graduate, or who may write a less glowing reference than otherwise; who may not think highly of you if you apply for a postgraduate course at the same institution, and may be unwilling to supervise you if you do; and who may be in a bad mood while grading your project. On the other hand, the cost to your integrity is fairly small, and you likely won't even think about simply having written their name in your acknowledgements section after a few months or a year.

Once you have any research experience, the fit of your experience to future lab becomes the next most important part of evaluating, and diversity of lab experiences for diversity's sake isn't terribly helpful.

Some companies will care, since they do research that is comparable (often superior) to what happens in academia. Google, Siemens, and IBM come to mind here. So, if you are looking for a _research_ position at such companies, they will know the publishing industry quite well. And they are active producers of papers as well.  Other companies will not know or care, but those probably don't care much about publications in any case. If they are just interested in the minimal amount of research that goes in to the next product, rather than long term thinking, then they likely hire people with other, more immediately useful, skills.  And, for some positions at the same large institutions I mentioned above, there will be little reason to care. But those aren't really research positions.  Expect that the research organizations within such large multinationals are just as sophisticated as is academia.  "

This situation is quite common for practicing academics; some papers find a home reasonably quickly and others sometimes need to be shopped around a bit before finding a home for them. Papers can take several _years_ to be accepted for publication, and academics are well aware of this, so there is no expectation that your papers should be published or even accepted prior to submitting your application. Even in the unfortunate event that one or more of these papers is of insufficient value to _ever_ be published, that just means it is not a positive, rather than being a negative.  Since you are applying for PhD programs, the papers you presently have under submission are relevant for your application. A potential supervisor is probably going to be interested in these --- _a fortiori_ if they are in the field of work of that academic. I see no reason why you would omit mentioning these papers in your application. The only thing that could potentially be a (very mild) negative is if the panel reads one of your papers and decides that it is of insufficient substance or value to warrant journal submission. Even then, at most that would show that you require a bit of guidance on the matter, which is something provided in a PhD program.  "

If you have at some point excellent quality peer-reviewed paper then remove those early accomplishments.  This basically correlates with how far you mastered to become a truly independent and original self-thinking scholar. Thus, this transition in time is quite flexible and typically happens roughly within your time as a PhD.  It is never a bad thing to be concise and to-the-point, in particular also in applications.

If an undergrad student in CS tells me that they have 25 papers, then I can definitely tell all of them are rubbish, even if they are not in predatory journals.  After becoming a 1st year PhD student (10+ years ago), I was invited to serve as a program committee member for many conferences in my home country. They were not predatory conferences, and they had proceeding in IEEE Explore. But I never wanted to publish anything there, even for a free trip going home.  The time they spent on writing 25 rubbish papers, the could have, instead, spent on writing just 1 paper in a top tier conference. Publishing 25 papers during undergraduate just means the student or the lab they worked at focus on the quantity instead of quality. That mentality is very very bad for future research.  "

There are several good things to be said about looking naive when asking this kind of question that may involve a substantial commitment by your professor to see it through:    * you may receive a more complete answer, where your professor takes some time to lay out their reasoning for you.   * That then provides you an opportunity for a follow-up, including a \"But...\" if the first answer was negative.   * if you approach this indirectly, leading with \"I'm surprised, I can not find any published work of this sort anywhere. I wonder if there's some reason...\" or similar, your professor may \"suddenly have the idea\" that it could and should become a publication.  The last point is particularly helpful. I'm not an expert in this, but I believe that professors can sometimes be more motivated by and enthusiastic about ideas they believe that they've had themselves, than by ideas that students suggest to them.

In a recent course, my dialogue with the instructor naturally extended, and soon he gave me materials and open problems on which I made progress/results that impressed him. After some more work, he offered to co-write and publish a paper with me on the topic.  Now, this particular instructor holds a very unpopular opinion (not ethically) that is his own novel work, which of course he is proud of, because if were to be true, it would have grand implications. Personally, _while recognizing that I am not nearly as knowledgeable as he is_ , I strictly disagree with his opinion. Most second opinions I read online disagreed on similar grounds to mine.  Unfortunately, he will almost certainly mention it in our paper, likely quite a few times. I have tried to *very lightly* bring up my disagreement as a matter of \"please teach me why I am wrong about this\", and he did not seem to take to it well. Additionally, sometimes in his papers, he uses language I think is too grand flowery while making claims I think are too broad and slightly unestablished.  On the other hand, he has been extremely kind and supportive of me, putting in the effort, and really doing his best as an advisor, which, I _really do appreciate_. As a bonus, he is relatively well published. Undoubtedly, a publication would be a good application item for me, perhaps helping me achieve more/better research opportunities as an undergraduate, and as such, further advancing my grad-school and academia aims. If it is relevant, the field is theoretical CS.  What should I do? Can this have negative effects on my future career?  ",

The minor hit to your intellectual purity (every successful collaboration involves compromise). I've certainly been on papers where I did not agree with every sentence.  The most important thing is that the scientific content is correct. Having a published paper as an undergraduate is a _big deal._  I wanted to add, though, that _in general_ , disagreeing with your co-authors, even faculty co-authors, is highly encouraged if you have solid arguments to back up your side. My advice is coming from this particular situation, where you've already tried the \"gentle nudge\" approach and gotten a lot of pushback, and this opinion is not going to introduce any scientific errors into the paper (just, essentially, a difference in philosophy). I've been in this situation, and sometimes the path of least resistance is the best one.  "

However, if you put Juan Eduardo as your first name, most professors will see that in the first name field, and they'll be more likely call you Juan Eduardo on the first day of class.  As for your last name, hyphenated last names are not uncommon in the U.S. Therefore, if you are applying to a U.S. school, it might be worth hyphenating the last name \u2013 but not if you feel like you are compromising your own identity to do so.

      "question_body": "  I'm an undergrad doing summer research in a CS lab. For the past few months, I've been working closely with a PhD student. I initially contacted his supervisor and his supervisor connected us to work together.  However, as time goes, I've noticed that the PhD student is rather incompetent at the field of research and doesn't have a big picture view of the project. For example, during our four months working towards a conference publication, he spent first three debugging an algorithm that's not theoretically grounded on a set of contrived settings. Even during our meeting with his supervisor, his supervisor pointed out the same thing - but he kept on going in his direction, ignoring what we say.  We could have changed our project direction much earlier, but because of his \"perseverance\" we are now trying to squeeze out a publication from something very contrived in the final month (out of the four months).  The **consequence to me** is that I'm asked, by the PhD student, to code up things / explore things that make no sense to me whatsoever. Obviously, I do not enjoy research with him and I'm not learning anything. My main contribution is a set of softwares for the lab that's not directly related to the project.  Is there something that I can do in this scenario? Should I communicate with his supervisor (I hope to get perspective from people who are themselves supervisors)? The PhD student is a nice person outside research, but I find it hard to restrain my frustration when talking to him about research.  ",

        "answer_body": "  If this is a summer research project, you don't have a lot of time left in which to change the situation.  Most likely, you'll end up having to accept that this research experience didn't turn out well. That happens! Try to look back and determine when you could have seen warning signs and what you could have done to change things. Use this learning to avoid or better manage similar situations in the future.  Charitably, learning to do research well is challenging, as is managing an undergrad, and maybe your PhD student has biffed one or both. With any luck they've learned something and won't do this again.  Beyond this, there are still several things you can walk away with:    1. Your lessons learned, as above. Any experience is valuable. At your level, the act of participating in research is, by itself, something of a differentiator and you are credited for having done it when applying to future endeavours. Also, interviewers for both grad school and industry are often interested in times when things went wrong    2. A letter of recommendation. These are key if you intend to pursue graduate study and are, I think, weighted much more heavily than a mere count of publications. If you're advised by a PhD student it's often the case that the professor will use their input (sometimes verbatim) to write an LoR. Note that this means your relationship with both the professor and PhD student is important.    3. A co-authorship. This is nice to have and you should pursue authorship within reason (don't pretend you can do much work during the semester). However, even if you were first author (it doesn't sound like it in this case), the LoR would still be much more important since it contextualizes you and your work.  All three of those take-aways seem very do-able from your description. Maybe the paper won't be as impactful, maybe you've learned less directly the things you wanted to, but you're not leaving empty-handed.  So what should you do with the time left?  Both the advisor and the PhD student know that you were not responsible for strategy on this project. Their opinion of you is based on the ideas you've brought to the table, how you've comported yourself, and the quality/quantity of your work. Even if the project itself has gone poorly, you may have been and should continue to be exemplary along all these axes.  If you have good relationships with the PhD student and advisor you might meet with them, separately or together, to try to do a post-mortem. If you do this, _do not blame the PhD student_ or harp too much on what might have been. The only reason to have this conversation is for _you to learn_ , not to confront anyone, so be sure to figure out ahead of time what you're interested in knowing. Perhaps the ideas you see as exciting and achievable are, in their estimation, too big/hard to accomplish in the timeframe available? Perhaps they prefer an incrementalist approach? I wouldn't suggest asking these questions directly, but they're ways of thinking about the problem.  **EDIT**  You say you know what you're doing. This provides an additional avenue you can explore.  Many universities have programs which pay undergraduates to do research they propose.    * At University of Minnesota this is called [UROP](https://ugresearch.umn.edu/opportunities/urop) and provides a stipend of $1,500 for 120 hours of research, paid through financial aid.   * At MIT it's also called [UROP](https://urop.mit.edu/research-exploration/urop/options/urop-options-pay-credit-volunteer/paid-urop) with a maximum funding award for fall and spring of $1,995 (140 total hours) and $6,840 (480 total hours) for the summer.  Typically the applications for these programs are [easy](https://ugresearch.umn.edu/project-proposal-tips): a page or two of writing covering the background, what you plan to do, maybe a timeline of milestones, and what faculty you plan to work with.  Since you say you have good ideas and have brought them up, you could try to arrange a UROP to work with your professor independently (not under the PhD student). Alternatively, you could bring your ideas to another professor and work with them (this lets you see another lab in action and sets you up for another recommendation). The only tricky point is if the PhD student feels like they somehow own the ideas you've brought up.  "

As it says on [this FAQ](https://support.jmir.org/hc/en-us/articles/360031369491-How-do- I-remove-my-preprint-):  > As disclosed in the preprint/open peer-review settings when authors submit > their paper, preprints cannot be \"unpublished\". \"Publication\" means to \"make > public\", and once something is public on the Internet, we cannot go back in > time and undo the publication.

Finally, there is a huge difference between a preprint server and a peer- reviewed journal. Certainly, you do not want garbage associated with your name in either; however, technical problems -- such as results that do not generalize to other datasets -- are not really a problem in the former as they would be in the latter. It is expected that a fraction of promising early results (which might make it to arXiv/bioRxiv) die on the vine before the study is completed and published in a peer-reviewed journal.  "

Perhaps one reason for this is that authors are frequently listed alphabetically in mathematics.  **Question:** In mathematics, would indicating which coauthors are undergraduates convey a positive message about the undergraduate's contribution to research, as well as my involvement of undergraduates in research?

        "answer_body": "  In terms of the question you ask at the end of your post, I would say that the annotating of undergraduate authors in your CV would generally be seen as a positive and not a negative remark on the contributions of the undergraduate. This is, of course, a guess as to the opinion of the hypothetical readers of your CV.  However, I think it is worth taking a minute to explain _why_ someone might be noting undergraduate authors. Based on my experience working as a professor at selective liberal arts colleges (SLACs) in the United States, it usually is your suggestion (3) -- that someone is trying to show how they can have productive research collaborations with undergraduate students. In many SLACs it often viewed very positively, if not expected, that a professor can involve undergraduates in the their research. When reviewing candidate CVs, I frequently encountered such annotations and would almost always have an interview question about how the candidate might involve undergraduates in their research.  Personally, I would not expect that someone would make these annotations to either indicated the quality of an undergraduate [(2) in your question], nor would it be related to any sort of author ordering. And while I can imagine the attitude of people seeking to highlight their contributions to a paper [(1) from your question], I cannot imagine those individuals calling out undergraduate co-authors in their CV. More likely, they would either fight to keep them off of the author list during publication or simply list the publication in their CV without an author list.  "

        "answer_body": "  > \"What recommendations do you have for mentoring REU students?\"  Put more care into the selection of your students. There's a common saying \"a bad student is worse than no student at all\". **The skill of selecting students that will be the best fit for you, is something that you acquire over time, and through experience**. It's not unusual to make a few mistakes early in your career as a mentor/supervisor. For example, simply selecting someone because they have excellent grades, GitHub projects, or even publications and letters of references, can _sometimes_ be a mistake: a 30-minute interview can be well worth the time and save you dozens of hours of time down the road. During that interview, make sure the student is on the same page with you (for example about what you said about your philosophy that the student is self- motivated). For example, you said:  > \"My mentorship philosophy is that the student should be self motivated to do > their research because that is 99% of research and if they don't have that > motivation to do the research it is their own fault.\"  But you're talking about an undergrad student, and expecting them to be self- motivated: I agree that you and me probably were, but most are not (in fact since starting my own research institute, I've found _postdocs_ who I thought would be absolutely delighted that I offered them a faculty position where they'd be able to run their own lab independently, and believe it or not, many of them say they prefer to have a project given to them! -- By the way, I learned this _**by interviewing them**_ , not by reading their resume and making assumptions).  For you, I would recommend asking them questions during the interview that will probe their likelihood to be the type of student that you seem to be expecting. You may find it surprising, but a lot of students who \"on paper\" have the highest grades or seem like they'd be the most cut out for research, tend actually not to be.  "

        "answer_body": "  I'm on the other side of the spectrum (a student who is remotely working on research with a professor for the summer). Perhaps my perspective can help.  Working from home without ever having met the people one is working with on something that they are probably new to, can honestly be quite demotivating and I sympathize with the student. This was something I was pretty worried about as well. Academia SE gave some really nice advice in this regard (see near the end).  Some initiative that my professor took that really helps me:  ## Expectations and Direction  As stated in the other answers as well, have a meet (preferably on Zoom or Skype) to discuss your expectations of what the student needs to work on over the Summer.  Don't just describe the broad area of the research and a general direction (this is also necessary). Discuss the particular direction of the project and the work that it involves. This gives the student some clarity and not make them feel like they are wandering around aimlessly. The more specific, the better (although I understand it's often difficult to give specifics while doing research, as things can go in unexpected directions. Just try your best).  Just as important is for you to ask the student about _their_ expectations with this project. What skills are they looking to learn? What is their end goal for the project? This will ensure that you are both on the same page and can work together proactively towards that goal (provided it's feasible).  ## Regular meets  This is really important. Have regular meets on Skype or Zoom, preferably with the camera on, to discuss their progress. This adds to the accountability for the student and it is much easier to ask questions on a (virtual) face-to-face meeting rather than email or Slack.  ## Socializing with the group  This may not be possible under all circumstances, but if it is possible, it can be so helpful! You might be part of a research group under a Professor, right? Having a weekly group meeting to give updates or a journal club to discuss papers with the entire group can be really beneficial, not just from a research perspective (if two people are working on similar projects, it helps to let ideas flow through a discussion) but also allows the student to socialize with the rest of the group and ask questions more freely. If there are other REU students, it will be nice to meet them. This _really_ helps with morale.  I live on another continent to the rest of them, so for us, there is a nice inter-cultural aspect to it too.  ## Talk about the big picture  Don't just go about it mechanically, where you give the student a task, they complete it, you review it and so on and so forth. Let the student know where their work stands in the grand scheme of things. Tell them about recent developments in the domain. Encourage them to read papers and think about their relevance to their own work. Again, this helps with the motivation for the student and helps make their work more meaningful.  ## Seminars and Colloquia  I am not entirely sure, but I assume if the student had been on campus, they would have been allowed to attend seminars that your department may hold? It is probably happening virtually now, so encourage your student to partake in it, even if it is not directly related to their research. All this is again part of making the REU experience more valuable and 'real'.  ## Things the Student Can (Should?) Do  I was really dreading the possibility that the virtual nature of the REU and a few difficult months prior (mental health wise) may completely demotivate me. I asked [this question](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/166504/how-to-make-the- most-of-an-online-research-internship) on Academia SE and they really came through (as usual). I am following the advice, and it's enhancing my research experience in many ways. I encourage you to share their advice with your own student. It essentially boils down to:    * Keep a log of your work.   * Type up notes of everything you learn and do.   * Have regular meets.  "

They are too inexperienced and need to learn a lot about process as well as the topic of the research as they do.  I think that funders recognize this and treat the funding as a kind of training, not a way to get the highest quality results.  But, to manage the students and assure that there is no misuse, someone, a professor probably, needs to keep involved with the students to assure that they keep on track.  Another problem with undergraduate research is that it is difficult to take on any open-ended questions since the time for the project is most likely very limited. This can be true even at the MS level. Doctoral research is intentionally open ended so that important questions can be asked and some definitive result obtained, though with less control over length of the project.  I'll note that in some situations in which a student gets some funds to join an existing research project in which papers have multiple authors, it might be possible for the student to make faster progress and (jointly) produce a higher quality product since there is probably more mentoring in such a situation.  But, don't expect much if you just give undergraduates money and don't keep involved in their work.  "

Undergraduate students can often work well under the frequent supervision of a graduate student, and I have seen many undergraduate students earn a second-author spot on a good paper.  _Some_ graduate students will be able to write high-quality papers, but others will not. It depends on their skill as a researcher, and since they are a graduate student, they are usually still developing those skills.  Overall, I don't see many students _misusing_ these grants. Most commonly, I see students who are unsure of what to do, or who underestimate the quality of work needed to achieve a journal publication. This can happen even to talented students who lack research experience.  Having a limited budget for funding is a common experience to most supervisors. It's hard to define a metric to find the \"best\" student, and the \"best\" probably varies for each advisor anyways. Qualities like relevant technical skills, motivation, and perseverance are probably useful to look for.  "

For a resume that is not publicly accessible, you could even add specific information from the manuscript, such as abstract, figures that show your contribution, or even the full manuscript as might be helpful for your resume.

But you may run into the problem that you can't find people who know the journal. For example, I don't recall having heard of IJPAM before, but it's not clear what that means. IJPAM is certainly not a famous or prestigious journal, but there are a lot of journals out there and nobody has heard of all of them.  [Beall's list](http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/) is a list of \"potential, possible, or probable predatory scholarly open-access publishers.\" The publisher of IJPAM (Academic Publications, Ltd.) appears on this list, which is a bad sign. You have to decide how to interpret it - maybe Beall has made a mistake, or maybe your criteria are different from his - but it's an important sign that you should investigate further.  You can then take a look at the actual papers and see what you think of them (or ask faculty members at your university). In the case of IJPAM, I found it quite worrisome. I looked at the [most recent issue](http://ijpam.eu/contents/2013-82-5/index.html) and found several papers that don't look like research papers at all: [Sudoko: the new smash hit puzzle game](http://ijpam.eu/contents/2013-82-5/4/4.pdf) and [Odd and even number cultures](http://ijpam.eu/contents/2013-82-5/5/5.pdf). This suggests IJPAM will publish nearly anything. If you've written a research paper, having it appear next to papers with no research content would look bad, so I recommend against publishing in IJPAM.  "

Given that structure, there is nothing unusual in naming a research area that interests you before you have direct experience in it, provided you have the general background knowledge to _begin_ to explore that area.  My advice, then, is just to say what your goals are and the direction you see yourself following. It will show that you have given thought to the options and have a plan. And, no one will hold you to that plan once you are accepted. Your initial advisor might be in the desired area or not, and may be more likely to be if you state the goal, but it is possible to change advisors when you get closer to choosing a research topic.  And, even stating what you now think of as a \"narrow\" area of focus, it will become much narrower once you start to choose a research question.

Either they misunderstood your mail, thinking it wasn't a complaint but a request in line with the first paragraph, or they were unprofessional.

If **yes** , the senior professor indeed acted fairly unprofessionally, although it is a reality that in most cases the person that you complained about will learn about _who_ complained about them as a matter of practicality (see some other answers for why this is).  If **no** , then, well, I am not sure what you thought would happen. Then you sent a random (presumably busy) senior person a mail about an issue that is in no way relevant to their tasks, and they did the only thing that makes sense from their perspective: glance the mail and forward to the person who is actually in charge for the request.  Look, I get that the first instinct when you get an unsatisfying decision is that you \"would like to talk to the manager\", but this is not how academia (or, really, any business) works. Department administrators delegate specific types of decisions to individual faculty members so that they _don't_ have to deal with them one-by-one anymore. This is arguably not helped by the fact that faculty in academia tend to be very wary to step onto each other's toes. Hence, you will need to work with the undergrad advisor on these issues, even if you don't care for him much.  "

It would be more proper to let him finish and submit the > thesis on whatever the student got in the past year, and the professor judge > the thesis and give a fair grade.  An important component that was not clear here is that what the contractual agreement between the student and the professor was. If the thesis proposal has three parts, A, B, C. And the student never finished C, but managed to publish a conference proceeding with materials in A & B. Technically speaking, the thesis is incomplete. And the professor is in the right to withhold the grade.  What is truly fishy to me is that, at least from what I know working in the US, graduation should not be possible unless all grades have been audited and finalized. If the professor gave an 80% and that grade got through audit, and then the student graduated. I really don't know how likely the institute will entertain a transcript revision.  > Anyway I am disappointed that he received no award at the graduation event > even he got 100% on his other courses this year.  This is really besides the point. I'd suggest using this opportunity as a training for the child, know the right and learn how the system operates. It will be helpful along the way in future. Think about:    * Now that graduation is all done, degree obtained. How much does the student want to get that thesis done? What kind of professional relationship would the student want to have with the said professor?    * If there was alleged exploitation, can the student put together a case and ask for mediation or grievance with the academic department? Who can be the student's advocate?    * If the student decided to follow through and complete the thesis, will the professor really be able to change the grade? What's the buy in? Can there be a documented procedure so that all parties involved (registrar, the department, the student and the faculty) are in agreement?    * Keep written proofs on all communication on this issue from this point and on.

It still seems relatively rare that undergraduates are able to publish significant research while enrolled in a US university. A few will, of course, but not so many due to the nature of the US curriculum, which is intended for a general education with only some specialization. Even in the major of a STEM degree the coverage tends to be broad rather than deep.  That isn't to say that US undergraduates don't do any research, but it is difficult to reach the \"research edge\" of specialization under the US system.  More important and more common in the evaluation of students with only a BS applying to doctoral programs is enthusiastic letters of recommendation from professors who have worked closely with candidates and can predict their success. You need a good GPA, and possibly good test scores as well, but, relatively speaking, letters are important.  Your Statement of Purpose is also important. It needs to show realizable goals as well as the seriousness to achieve them.

      "question_body": "  I wanted to bring up an issue I faced recently and figure out how much my graduate school application will be affected by this. For some background, I am a sophomore math major at a good public school. In the first semester of my second year(i.e Fall 2020), I faced many problems that led to a case of terrible depression. I ended up getting an F in an art history class and two Bs in Probability Theory and another math grad class. There were many other internet access issues piled onto the existing problems as well. It would be an exaggeration to say that I even participated in the class. I only submitted about half the assignments and got an average score on the final exams.  I had a 3.91 GPA in my first year taking the major upper-div math courses(Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Real Analysis) and a graduate class in commutative algebra. I got all As in my math classes with one or two A-s in some unrelated classes. In my second semester of my second year, I am trying my best to fix this issue. I will likely get 5 As this semester including 3 key math graduate classes. I think I'll maintain this streak in my third year as well. At this point, my GPA is around 3.5 . By the time I apply to graduate school, I can hope to get it to around 3.7-3.82. My math GPA will be higher than that. I am currently aiming to get into a good PhD program(say a top 20 program, very roughly). I already have some pretty good connections with some faculty who are quite renowned in their fields and may end up getting good letters. I may also have some research opportunities lined up within the next year. I also took the math subject GRE and did well on it.  Will I be penalized for the drop in grades that semester when it comes to graduate school applications? Many of the other factors(GRE, recommendation letters) look decent enough on paper for now except for my GPA. Most of the people I know who got into a math PhD program have a near-perfect GPA. It seems almost like a minimum requirement at this point.  I'd be especially glad to receive a response from someone very familiar with the math PhD admission process or another student who faced similar circumstances.  ",

Remember that GPA/GRE are only **one** portion of your application.

Over the months, I sometimes get some ideas that I think can offer either a. improvement over some result or b. an entirely new, novel approach (more of the latter). To be more specific, at my level of knowledge in the subject, any idea that I have is usually 'applied' (i.e. using computational techniques to solve a problem in another field). I have a bunch of ideas. I am well aware that most are probably not good at all, but I reckon that some have potential (I would also like to clarify that I am not - not even close - claiming that I've found some magical solution to a well known problem like the P NP problem).  So here is the concern I am addressing:  With the pandemic, it is has been quite difficult to collaborate and form connections (especially at the undergrad level for research). I also don't think I have enough theoretical rigor to formally write about a paper, run the code, and publish by myself. I also dislike the feeling of waiting a few years until I gain some more skills and knowledge for two reasons: a. the longer I am removed from my original thought, the less likely it is that I will recall what exactly I meant at the time and b. the (admittedly probably not that high) risk of someone else publishing something similar before me.  In sum, I have thought of a couple of methods for addressing this concern that include emailing around to get some more senior collaborators (I am assume this is the recommended approach) and also this: What if I post my initial results and/or raw ideas on something like a blog? More specifically, what sort of intellectual property can I claim? Would such material be citable in actual papers? Or would doing this effectively just give away my thoughts for free and allow someone else to take on the initiative without ackowledging my work? If some writeups are longer, serious, and paper-like, can such things be linked on Google Scholar, DOI, etc.? I have come across several posts of similar nature that include things like Bibtex citations at the end (examples: [here](https://haythamfayek.com/2016/04/21/speech-processing-for-machine- learning.html), [here](http://kvfrans.com/stampca-conditional-neural-cellular- automata/), and [here](https://ruder.io/research-highlights-2020/)).  So... what advice would you give? Again, I am very young in terms of the academic world, but I don't want that to be a hindrance\u2014I just feel a little weary not actively pursuing my ideas.  ",

If you're an undergraduate student who is really eager to do research, and you've demonstrated your academic talents in your studies, I think that your best course of action would probably be to contact your professors and ask them if it would be possible to do an internship with them over the summer. Many universities have summer internship programs for undergraduates, and your professors might be able to point you in right direction for applying for one.  Then, once you've finished your undergraduate degree, if you've still got a desire for academic research (rather than going into industry to solve problems in \"the real world\"), you could apply for postgraduate study at your university of choice, and having completed a summer research internship would likely assist you in that.  If you really want to be taken seriously in academia, I would strongly recommend that you do a postgraduate degree; it's very easy for \"independent researchers\" to wind up getting written off as quacks because they often lack the skills to properly write a high-quality research paper. You're in computer science, however, so if you wind up employed by a company in industry who is performing research in an area, you might be able to use your company as your affiliation to get started in academic publishing rather than that of your university.

        "answer_body": "  I have to preface my answer by saying that what you're doing - independent reading and trying to solve problems - is exactly what PhD programs are for and I strongly encourage you to consider pursuing a PhD :)  It sounds like your post boils down to 1. \"is finding a more senior collaborator a good idea and how would I do that?\" and 2. \"is posting my ideas online going to backfire\". In short, yes I think finding a more senior collaborator is a good idea, and yes people _might_ take your idea if you post it online, but I don't think that will happen. The dominating factor is that, as someone relatively new to academia, your ideas for a research project probably need a lot of adjustment before they can really contribute to your field (nothing personal about this - I'm basing this judgement off of how much my own ideas have needed feedback).  **So what is the best way forward:** Finding a good mentor is the best outcome. They would be able to give you feedback on your ideas, help you learn any new skills you need, and hopefully connect you to other people in the field. A mentor could either be a professor you like personally, or the professor at your school who's subject matter is closest to what you're interested in. If there's no faculty member at your school familiar with the subjects you've read up on, posting your idea online might be your best option for feedback. I doubt people will steal your idea because as someone new to the field, there's a real possibility other people have already considered it. And if it is a novel idea, it probably requires a lot of work to turn into something that can be published or monetized. I would still recommend you go to one of your professor and ask to do research with them. Even if the research isn't actively pursuing one of your ideas, it will still help you learn about the field, best research practices, and prep you for grad school if you decide that's what you want to do.  I think you're right to want to follow up on these ideas now rather than put them off a few years. Even if they don't pan out, you'll learn some great skills along the way.  "

My answer is contingent on that. I am not in CS, but I don't think the answer is field specific. (in fact it is probably not even specific to academia, but also holds for industry to some degree)  The main question I want answered when I look at PhD applications is:    * Can this person independently perform high quality work? Or do I have a reasonable expectation that it will be easy to teach the person to do so?  Strong indicators for this are:    * Consistently good performance in courses.   * A well-written undergraduate thesis which reflects independent work.   * A publication based on thesis work, where it is clear that the student was a driving force.   * Independent projects performed at eg. summer schools.  Weaker, but still good, indicators are:    * Recommendation letters highlighting the candidate's independence.   * Publications where it is clear that everything was completely driven by a supervisor, and the student was just along for the ride.   * Experience working with different supervisors.  Red flags:    * A weak thesis, not reflecting independent work at all.   * Poor performance in courses.  If I got an application from a person with essentially no undergraduate thesis, but a compilation of pre-prints with co-authors, my natural question would be if the person has actually done any of this work themselves. I am not hiring the full team who published these papers - I am hiring _one_ student, who is likely the most junior person on those teams. I would need to be convinced that these papers are the product of _your_ work. You could do that by:    * Specifying your contribution to the individual papers in your application.   * Actually writing a full thesis, and not a compilation, at mark the papers as \"based on thesis X\". This would come off very strong, especially if they eventually get published.   * Having a supervisor write a recommendation letter saying that, yes, you did a lot of work.  "

When doing this, have in mind students at your university taking similar modules and write enough so that they could understand your research topic.   * Have a clear goal of what you want to get out of the project, eg a paper, and a rough timeline, if appropriate. This will motivate you. In my case, my goal was to get a strong letter of recommendation from him for my PhD applications. I ended up getting a PhD offer to work with him.  "

If the writer felt less than routinely supportive they should probably not have written the letter (and in most cases they wouldn't). So one idea is to talk to your letter writers. Don't even hint that you worry they wrote a less than strong letter: just express your concerns and ask how you can do better.

At the same time, economic constraints (partly due to uncertainty about the course of the pandemic) are reducing the number of offers we can make, and also reducing the volatility we can tolerate in the outcomes of offers made.  Further, the partly-good idea of the April 15 common date (in the U.S.) for commitment _to_ grad programs tends to make us prefer to make offers to (good) people who've given some indication that they'd come to our program if we made the offer. E.g., at least _some_ explicit mention of our university and some relevant people on our faculty. Otherwise, we figure we're just a back-up, and the April 15 thing has game-theoretic implications.  So there's a confluence of complications in this cycle.  EDIT: currently, as ever, contacting potentially relevant faculty by email is some evidence of your genuine interest. But/and this should be clear in your statement of purpose. If you don't get a first-round offer from a school, you can tell the Grad Office (in that dept) that you still are definitely interested in being on their \"wait list\" (or whatever they call it). And follow up again on April 14... :) Of course (!!!) if you send spammy-sounding emails, it won't help at all.  EDIT2: and, as Noah Snyder comments, international students may cost a department more in terms of the budget-games of tuition, and may create complications in terms of English fluency for functioning as teaching assistants. The other current features amplify these aspects in an unfortunate way.  I should also note that at my univ the math dept is _NOT_ allowed to claim that we cannot cover all the math courses, due to reduced personnel (hiring freeze on faculty, for example). So we really need all new grad students (if not on fellowships or RA's) to be able to \"hit the ground running\" in terms of teaching. English problems are very unhelpful.  "

The time between writing the paper and publishing it can also be long and indeterminate if the journal is reputable. Conference publication is a bit more time predictable, since the conference will be held on a certain date, but if you miss a deadline, the next opportunity might be a year away.  If you are doing something hard, then my recommendation would be to keep at it.

Since I'm considering applying for a PhD program after graduation, I've connected with a professor to work under him. In particular, I'm working more closely with one of his PhD students. My plan is to work for them for a year. I have good background knowledge in the field and even some previous research experience. We've been working together for a month.  Today, the PhD student received a warning from his advisor (i.e., the professor whom I made contact with) that he's progressing a bit too slowly - he published last year, but it looks like he's not ready for publishing this year at all.  The PhD student told me this and he said he's not sure about his directions, and would welcome my input. Although it's nice to have my input, this makes me very confused about my role in this project. Our field of research is a little theoretical, so I'm certainly not as qualified as him to lead projects and to come up with novel ideas (since he knows the literature much better than I do), but if I don't do this I risk having no publications (which is very important for machine learning PhD applications) at all during this research experience.  I would appreciate any thoughts on my situation.  ",

Having an idea of where you want to go in research is a big plus, even if not entirely settled. So, yes, it is good to mention the specific areas that most interest you and any experience you have with those.  But acceptance depends on many things, from GPA to letters of recommendation.  I'd suggest that, other things being equal, having an idea of what you want to do in grad school will be an advantage and will help you choose more precisely when it comes time to do so.  But doctoral studies in the US normally start with a lot of advanced coursework leading up to the comprehensive exams so that candidates have a fairly broad exposure to mathematical concepts even before they specialize (and specialize...) on a dissertation topic.  It might be a mistake, however, to refuse to consider other options. Keep an open mind. You will have plenty of time to develop a formal plan.  * * *  My own experience was that, at entry, I would have been pretty happy with anything in analysis or topology, but nothing specific beyond that.

The rest of the thesis is her own work (introduction, results, discussion, etc.). While any plagiarism is bad, is this cause for worry?

        "answer_body": "  There is some effect, certainly, but it is probably a poor strategy to depend too much on it. If you look at what the American Mathematical Society, for example, has published in the past three or so years you will get a sense of where the _current_ action is. It won't include my old specialty, hard classical analysis, as the number of open problems there as decreased relative to those available in newer fields.  However, a given university will usually have a specific need when they put out an announcement. It might be a hot area or maybe not, since there is value in having a broad range of specialties on a faculty if it is possible. So, if I were 35 years younger, I might have a few openings available.  But there are two negatives that I can think of. First, things change. You are unlikely to be a serious contender for a faculty position for more than five years (I'm assuming you are asking about the US, actually). A lot can happen in a field in that time if those \"essential to answer\" questions actually get answered. The currently hot field may cool appreciably, to be replaced by the next big thing.  The other, and this is even more serious. It is hard to say where your mathematical insights will come. Mathematical insight is specific to a field (or even a small subfield), not general. You can have (as I did) tremendous insight into real analysis and almost none in abstract algebra (especially Ring Theory). I could solve the necessary problems in a course, but lacked the insight to push against the frontiers in algebra. You can seek insight and it may come, but it is an elusive thing. So, if you pick a hot field, a priori, just because it is flaming at the moment you may find the necessary insight impossible to attain while that area cools.  Rather, I suggest at your current level of development, that you seek a broad understanding of many mathematical areas and choose later, based on your insights and the then current evidence about the academic market, what you want to do. And the market is now very tight.  Finally, there is an old saying: You don't choose mathematics. Mathematics Chooses you.  But, I think the same can be said, almost as validly, for the various subfields within mathematics. I was \"chosen\" by classical real analysis.  "

In my area, there are fairly good conferences which have not even been ranked by CORE, despite being organized by top researchers and being around for more than 15 years.

        "answer_body": "  Patents and software licenses are completely different. Relatively little software is actually patented, and I'd suspect the university wants to be involved in any patent applications. University involvement in patents is also a way for a researcher to avoid the high cost of patenting anything (lawyers and such).  Patents need to be registered. Copyrights don't (US law, but it can vary elsewhere). Publishing a \"creative work\" implies a copyright for the creator.  A software license is usually about permitting some limited use of copyrighted materials, though patents can also be licensed. Some, but not all, universities want a say in software licensing. More want a say in patents.  Distinguish carefully between copyright, patent, and trade-secret (which doesn't apply here). All apply in different ways to IP.  In general (US, anyway) creative works get an automatic copyright. Only \"inventions\" are subject to possible patent. There is some controversy about whether a piece of software is an \"invention\", but in recent years it has often been considered so. This has led to some strange outcomes.  Currently (US again) copyright lasts a long time. Disney would like it to be infinite. Patents are more limited. This pushes some to prefer copyright when there is a choice.  * * *  A college or university that isn't heavily involved in research (teaching institutions) may have much less restrictive arrangements generally, since such questions arise less frequently - especially for patents.  * * *  The [Public Domain article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain) on Wikipedia has a general discussion of various aspects of IP and how long protections last. There are other, more specific, articles there, also.  "

The university lawyers are probably busy trying to keep the university from being sued for any of several reasons and don't have time to go sort out legal review for a million software licenses. Outside counsel will eat your entire group budget as a retainer.  The cost of lawyers has to be balanced against the fact that most academic software is functionally valueless. Spending a lot of money and time to ensure you have the correct rights over something that is worth nothing is a good way to be an unsuccessful academic.  Finally, if you do have something of value and you spin it out to a startup, the university can get it's taste by taking a low-double-digit dilutive share or a couple percent non-dilutive (with the goal of cashing out around series A). So the school doesn't even have to pay a lot of attention to what you're doing until you try to turn it into a company.  Related to your edit- you might be able to refuse to allow the parts you've written get released by claiming copyright over your specific work, but that will probably destroy your current relationship with your group. They are also free to clean-room reimplement whatever you wrote and cut you out entirely. If you think it's valuable you'd be better off trying to go into business with the other people who control parts of the product, fighting them is a very bad idea. The university is not interested in getting involved until there's money on the table and will side with the professor they've invested in almost 100% of the time.  Also, if you've committed your code to a project with an existing license (like MIT) you've already released it under a permissive license and you can't revoke that.  "

Even without the conference being a major one (which would, of course, be better), acceptance shows that your paper passed peer review. That is the major difference to a preprint: anyone can in principle upload anything to a preprint server, so the value of having one \"published\" is (by itself) close to zero.  As a way to move forward, I suggest checking two things:    * Can you acquire funding from a different source? Often, universities are research will have special programs which you might apply to. Some conference even allow requesting a waiver if you're not funded. It's worth checking these avenues.   * Are there any other (similar, maybe even better) conferences that you can apply to where the cost is manageable, or which provide such a waiver?  On the other hand, if you plan to make a journal version, that is an alternative, too. But keep in mind that the time to get a journal paper published may be longer (with sometimes multiple rounds of peer review and multiple re-submissions if the paper is rejected), and, in particular, not foreseeable. Some papers take a long time until they appear in a journal, and that might be after you need the paper to appear on your CV in your application. Therefore, it's worth trying to find a way for the conference paper to get published.  "

It is considered **very bad form** to send a paper to review, and then retract it post-acceptance. There are some exceptions to the rule (e.g. sudden illness, non-trivial errors in the results or data), such a retraction (or simply not paying the conference fees) can reflect very bad on you, as it points to:    * Lack of foresight if the reason is lack of funds.  Conferences typically have publication and attendance fees. As historical fees are usually known, this is an expense that could have easily been foreseen. This is even more true during the current pandemic situation, as many conference fees are reduced to a fraction of their typical price and the conferences shifted to online events.    * Lack of respect for reviewers time (if the reason is lack of funds; or lack of time to do the required revisions).  In order for a paper to get accepted to a conference, it will get assigned to an editor / session chair. That person will then need to read at least the abstract and the keywords, and attempt to solicit 2 or 3 reviewers for your paper. They will contact more than that, and many will refuse. Finally, the editor/chair will read the reviews, and will have the responsibility of making the final decision about acceptance or rejection (it's not as simple as a ranking list where top-X get in). Indicating that you never had the intention of publishing shows a disregard for this process and the time of all the people involved.    * Problems in academic conduct (if the reason is e.g. a dispute between co-authors).  It does not reflect well on anybody if you can't keep it civil with your co- authors for the period of time between submission and publication.    * Problems with research rigour (if the reason is non-trivial errors in the results).  Infinitely better post-acceptance than post-publication, but... well.    * If you do not give a reason, nothing good will be assumed.  My point not to make you feel bad, but that a paper that was peer-reviewed and accepted for publication, but not published (due to not paying conference fees/not presenting) **does not give you any bragging rights** on your CV. And while your _plans_ to publish it in a journal certainly sound nice, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  To address your current situation: the one thing worse than retracting the paper by quietly not paying the conference fees is paying the conference fees and then quietly not showing up to present your paper. That might even land you on some blacklists on larger conferences, e.g. IEEE organised. If you truly can not find funding, I would suggest **informing the conference as soon as possible for your reasons for retraction, and offering your apologies for your lack of foresight** , rather than just quietly not paying.  I second [@cheersmate](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/164350/4249)'s suggestions to look if the conference can waver the fees, or has any \"student support\" mini-grants, or if something might be available through your University (or even through a lab/team/professor if you are associated to one through an internship or TAing) or your co-authors. While it would have been better to do all this before submission, I hope you still find an avenue that allows you to publish your paper.  "

Undergrads do not put a lot on the table, and more than adding any substantial value to the field via research, it is about gaining useful experience and making connections with professors in order to secure future LoRs. Do I have the right idea here, or am I missing something?  If we think specifically about _pure_ mathematics, then quite a bit of the initial process before even trying to do any research is essentially directed reading.

        "answer_body": "  If by \"funded\" direct payments (wages) are meant, then my experience at **US universities (science/engineering departments)** is that they are typically not _during the semester_. The mindset goes something like this:    * The positions are effectively unpaid internships that will provide the students with experience and skills, which are a form of compensation in applying for jobs, grad school, etc.   * The positions are \"entry level\" and there is high turnover, so the students are expected to first demonstrate competence in the lab and long(er)-term interest in working there before payment becomes an option   * Alternative to cash payment, many US schools reward students with course credit for research, which, at a private school in the US, works out to better than minimum wage (and an an hourly basis better than the what the doctoral students are getting...)  Summer undergraduate research is typically paid, but for my labs, the \"interning\" during the semester is the gatekeeping - we would never hire a total unknown to work full-time in the lab over the summer and potentially do more harm than good. Such students then are usually elevated to acknowledgements and authorship on published research work, because they're making significant contributions.  The system in **Germany** , where I currently work, is worth considering for contrast: we have extensive formal, paid undergraduate labor (\"HiWis\"), but the students are formally employees with work contracts. They do contract work - all the repetitive, grunt tasks (lots of cleaning, in particular). This is also often perceived as a kind of gatekeeping to joining a research group as a master's student, but I am unaware of HiWis being considered for real research, like the summer programs in the US or being added to papers as authors or contributors.  The preceding all addresses the factual part of the question (even if lacking hard facts), but as for the normative question, I believe student researchers should be _compensated_ and that depending not only on the student's financial situation, but also career goals, compensation in the form of wages, experience, course credits, and research credit (e.g. authorship) all have different kinds of value and should continue to be options.  Finally, from the perspective of someone managing research, funding is often tight. Being able to offer non-cash compensation to get students into the lab and started on work has a potential to be a win-win - this is exactly my experience from my doctorate: new lab, not a lot of money, eager student. Two semesters of unpaid assistance in the lab and we wrote a proposal for summer funding (accepted) and then we were able to do it again the next year plus get the student on both conference and peer-reviewed publications as an author.

They were _jobs,_ and US law requires them to be paid. They didn't pay a lot, but I kept them going as long as I could since they covered my rent until I graduated and went to grad school at UT. At the time they had no benefits (health care, retirement, etc.), which I think is wrong, but that's the way it was then.

I don't know how either of them was funded. I think the prof I worked for may have had some departmental money and some NSF money, but he just asked me to do some little projects that seemed to only be of interest to himself and maybe part of his personal experimental interests.

Since this is research, you will most likely be learning new things that you have only touched on in your undergraduate degree. If you tried to learn both topics at the same time this could lead to confusion and slow your rate of learning. Keep in mind that this is also your break time so you can come back and continue learning in your next semester.  So what to say to the local professor, basically just something like:  > Dear XXX, > > Thank you for the offer but unfortunately I must decline. At the time of > offer I had already accepted a different summer research internship at YYY > university. However I am very interested in your work and would be > interested in doing research in your lab at <insert next break or semester > here, or some vague time in the future>. > > Regards, ZZZ  Of course only put that last part if you are seriously interested, which from your original post it sounds like you are. In addition you could look to see if there is an undergrad research course if you are thinking of doing research during the semester so your work counts towards your undergrad.  From the professors perspective they may not get you as a research assistant, but they now know they may potentially have a good/interested student who had demonstrated a professional behaviour lined up for the future. And one that will also already have some prior research experience.  "

You are likely to get burnt out, and not give your all to either project to the frustration of the people hiring you. Also, one of the really beneficial aspects of internships for furthering your career are references. You won't get good references if you spread yourself thin and it impacts your work, which it almost surely will. You might also be in a tricky position in the future if you did not disclose that you were doing two internships two both parties. If you ever want to use professional networking sites like linkedin, or to put your cv online and either side sees this and realises afterwards that you were two- timing it would seriously burn bridges.  Plus, this is a bit unethical. You can't make the most of both internships, and are taking the opportunity from someone else. In my case this only hit me after I began the internships, and I felt really really awful about it.  "

      "question_title": "How to deal with incompetent PhD student as an undergrad  ",
      "question_body": "  I am an undergrad who was recruited to join a lab by this PhD student and help her with her thesis, but since working with her I have come to the conclusion that she is incompetent and probably not going to finish her PhD. I often question her judgment especially related to safety and her research. This is my first research job, so sometimes I am unsure if this is normal, but at the same time I don't want to pick up bad habits. Some of the highlights include:    * Lack of safety awareness. No gloves/splash goggles when working with (hot) concentrated acids and bases. Some of these experiments are run outside the fume hood, and sometimes on the floor when there is no space on the lab bench. Lab bench is a mess and when I mention cleaning up she says it'll take too much time.   * When I ask her about her research proposal, she seems confused and is unable to answer basic questions about previous results. Previous experiments all seem inconclusive, need to be rerun, or she can't remember. One of the major part of her proposal is to investigate a particular mechanism, but when I ask what tests she plans on running, she has no idea.   * I will talk to her about papers that I found, sometimes exactly matching the experiments we want to run, and she seems surprised. I will mention things from papers we've both read or thesis of previous students and she has no clue so most conversations about research is unproductive or she offers very superficial, obvious observations. Conversations with other group members are much more productive.   * She (and I) have very little to share during group meetings because experiments are sometimes poorly designed and she does not plan them out. She will have a rough idea of what she wants to do, but no procedures or plan so lab time is spent planning the experiments out. She seems to have a very bizarre attention to some details but not others. For example, when running some high purity experiments she doesn't want us to wash the beakers with soap due to fear of contamination, but then she'll proceed to run these experiments on the dirty lab floor.   * She has poor organization and samples are sometimes lost or results are not written down.   * She has very rudimentary technical skills. I have watched her use the computer multiple times and instructions on how to use simple programs need to be written down step-by-step with very specific instructions on which button to press... etc. Sometimes she wants me to write a program from a paper, but she is so inept that she is unable to offer any assistance/advice, and after I'm finished writing the program she will have no clue how it works.  At times, it seems like I'm doing all the literature search, running the experiments, writing the programs, and coming up with new ideas while she grades homework. She says she is going to graduate this year.  Our PI is a very hands off person. I spend a lot of time reading literature and have ideas of other experiments we can run related to this research area in general. I would like to run these experiments myself. Since we're working in the same research area, however, sometimes when I discuss these ideas the grad student will mention wanting to include it in her thesis (even though it wasn't in her proposal). And because of how unproductive she is, I would prefer not to work with her anyways. I'm also concerned that the PI will think that these are good ideas and that I should work with this student to test them, particularly because I am an undergrad.  How can I politely distance myself with her and start doing some independent research?  ",

Obvious safety problems are often accompanied by even worse, hidden problems.  Consult your university's safety policy to determine if you can/should/must report this situation.  The other problems are insignificant by comparison. Find a new PI.  "

[disclaimer: I say this even not knowing the other side of the story, I do not care, this is much more serious than sexual harassment, which is an issue that get people fired with one-sided stories, at least in theory]  Regarding you: you are undergrad, you now have enough experience, change immmediately PI/lab/project.  Do not worry about the ideas you had now, you already demonstrate critical thinking and, when exposed to literature and state-of-art science, I can assure you will have other sparkling ideas to follow.  Plus, an idea is **not** a good idea if developed by only one person. If your actual PI will \"steal\" your ideas, much better, 1-2 years down the road you can apply for fundings to develop the ideas with the backup of reference and citations (maybe even a reference letter) from PI's publications, providing you solid ground to further the work in the field: science is not about who is first having the idea, it's about the first that publish the idea (or the last, since science is an incremental business ;), you know, standing on the shoulder of giants and all that motivational crap that you can find in Linkedin&aphorisms from Abraham Lincoln [1]).  New research topics/ideas are 10% intuition and 90% implementation, if you had these novel ideas just by reading literature and by being exposed to that toxic (in the real meaning of the word) lab, for sure these ideas are circulating and coming to the mind of the professional of R&D (i.e. other PhDs and PostDoc working in other labs and preparing their proposals to get funded ...).  Each person is unique, but ideas are _**not**_. We often celebrate the faster person having some ideas and developing them (and we are deeply wrong in this), do not neglect that person was not the only one and his/her ideas would have nil-value if he/she was the only one working on those ideas.

        "answer_body": "  > How can I **politely** distance myself with her ... (emphasis added)  You can be fully honest without using judgmental terms such as \"incompetent\". You can also approach the situation as though having a PI who is \"hands-off\" does not mean that you have a PI who is unwilling to fix safety violations.  The safety concerns, as noted, can be grounds for you to leave immediately. Certainly, with any indication of an immediate, dire threat to your safety, leave the lab with no hesitation. In those cases where you feel inclined to report such violations to higher authorities, keep in mind that you have an obligation to inform the PI as the first responsible authority in the chain. By example, an emergency phone call to your campus equivalent 911 number must be followed directly by a call, text, or email to the PI. In the US, academic laboratories are now required to have those contact points visibly posted on the outside of the laboratory doors.  Should you wish otherwise to continue with the current PI, a potentially workable alternative would be to ask that you have your own workspace physically separated from the student in question. When you would want to do this, you have to address the PI in an opening request. By example:    * Since I have been working in the laboratory with (student's name), I have been confronted with situations that I feel are violations of safety protocols. I no longer feel comfortable working in the same physical laboratory space as (student's name). I would like to meet with you to discuss my concerns and to understand how they should be properly addressed.  Independent of the immediate, dire safety violations, you can also decide how far you really want to get involved in the longer game to make changes to the underlying violations that you see. When you decide that you must/will report such violations, do so in writing. Email the student. By example:    * I came to the laboratory today at 9am. An open container of what appeared to be concentrated acid was sitting on the bench top. I had to leave the laboratory out of safety concerns and could not do my work. Let me know when you have cleaned up so that I can get back to my research work.    * I had arranged with you yesterday that I would need to have the fume hood clear for my research work. I came to the laboratory today at 9am. The fume hood was not cleared. I had to leave the laboratory and could not do my work. Let me know when you have cleared the fume hood so that I can get back to my research work.  You can consider the balance of copying the PI or not on these emails. If the graduate student seems receptive to email as \"polite\" reminders, you may do better to avoid essentially spamming every complaint that you have to the PI. Alternatively, you may want to copy the PI for good reason, for example if the violation that you are reporting is extremely serious or is something that was raised in a previous group meeting and yet still remains unresolved by some agreed upon time at that meeting.  If you must report violations to the department head/chair or to the safety officers, you should do so without going around the PI as your first step. Collect your message with date stamps. Send them in bulk to the PI.    * I can no longer work in the laboratory because (student's name) is not providing me with a safe, effective work space. I am enclosing a record of messages to (student's name). They show that, over the past weeks, I have been able to complete any research activities because (student's name) is not doing her job. I would like to meet with you to determine how best to proceed.  At some point, a growing collection of non-critical safety violations can become dire and immediate in their own right, especially when they go unattended despite due notices. When you would wish to raise such a case to an even higher authority beyond the PI, it helps to have the written records (emails) in order. Do the respect to give due notice also to the PI, for example    * We have discussed a range of safety violations at our group meetings. Because the violations continue to happen, I can no longer continue working in the laboratory. As I leave, I am also sending the attached list of my records of reporting the numerous safety violations to the (chair / safety office) because, unless corrected, these violations can pose an inadvertent danger to anyone who might enter the laboratory without advanced notice.  > ... and start doing some independent research?  From the rest of your report, it sounds as though you already have a good grasp of how to start. Your obligation going forward is not to the student. It is to the PI who has given you permission to work in the laboratory with the student. Perhaps you should re-orient your research goals accordingly. To this end, your next step might be to ask for a meeting in an email to the PI. By example:    * I have been working with (student's name) for the past few months. At this point, I believe that I have a strong grasp of the research goals and a good set of workable ideas in order to achieve them. I would like to present a proposal for a research project that I can undertake independently of (student's name). Are you available for this meeting?  Before you do, create what I might call a \"Proposal for Independent Undergraduate Research\". Outline how you will work on a topic that can be done entirely separate from the goals of the PhD student. Address how your results are truly able to be done separate from those being studied by the PhD student. Basically, structure your proposal such that, if your work is never done, the PhD student is not harmed and, if your proposed work is completed, the PhD student can REFERENCE the results but not include them as though they are also her own work. The \"polite\" return on this investment is likely that you may correspondingly have to REFERENCE results obtained by the PhD student to the degree that they support or enable your research to proceed.  Finally, you are not responsible for whether the PhD student does or does not complete her dissertation successfully. Your observations of her work habits, skills, aptitude, and motivation are part of lessons in life-long learning on how to cope with others who are not as organized or as able to perform in the same ways as you can. Disengage from the emotional responses these observations bring and make sound, non-judgmental, professional decisions on where you want to go next for your own success.  "

You're not the first person to [make a mistake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retractions_in_academic_publishing#Retraction_for_error), and people are not likely to know that you had been celebrating (besides, even if you were ... so what?). The fact that you found the error yourself is furthermore a good sign, since it means you're taking your work seriously and subjecting it to the scrutiny it deserves.  Take a look at [this](http://backreaction.blogspot.com/2019/11/dark-energy- might-not-exist-after-all.html). The first direct evidence for dark energy goes back to the late 1990s, when two groups claimed to have discovered it. This was a big deal since dark energy supposedly makes up ~70% of the energy content of our universe. After follow-up work confirmed it, the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to the discoverers.  And then in 2019, we get [this paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2019/11/aa36373-19/aa36373-19.html):  > Thus the cosmic acceleration deduced from supernovae may be an artefact of > our being non-Copernican observers, rather than evidence for a dominant > component of \u201cdark energy\u201d in the Universe.  In other words: the paper claims the discovery was wrong. Let's say that again: this recently-published paper claims that the 2011 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded _incorrectly_.  Imagine you are one of the three 2011 Nobel laureates in physics who's been celebrating for 8 years, and this result turns out to be robust. Is your reaction:    * Yay! Our knowledge of the universe has advanced yet again! Or is it:   * Oh my God, people are going to look at me and think I'm an embarrassing failure. I've been celebrating for twenty years, given plenty of talks discussing my results, even won a Nobel Prize, and my work is wrong. Panic!  I think most people will think the second reaction is pretty silly. If you think so too, then listen to your supervisor, who's a much more experienced academic than you and should know what to do. Perhaps there's something you can salvage from the work, which might make it less interesting but still a solid result, for example. Or perhaps the method you used can be adapted to a different problem. Either way, you've learned something. If you stay in research, you'll be meeting this kind of issue often, so don't worry too much about it.  "

All this was posted on his personal webpage and went out as news to the entire computer science community; you can imagine the embarrassment he must have faced when having to announce that this major result everyone was excited about was wrong!

With the difference that I found my mistake after manuscript submission.  The procedure then was to retract the manuscript with a letter explaining that a mistake had been found so that we please ask to retract the manuscript. IIRC the editor responded that if we hand in a corrected version until $deadline it would be considered a resubmission - otherwise (later) we'd be required to submit as a new paper. That was all, and I can tell you that it's not particularly painful.  Also, as a reviewer I once received an email just a few days after the manuscript came (so long before the review deadline) that my review was not needed any more.

Having read many research papers and having worked with an adviser has made me much more aware about best practices concerning presentation and reporting of results in published research.  I have also published a paper when I was a junior in college. Looking back at it now (its been around 2-3 years), compared to the standards set by papers I have read, my work is very sloppy.  More specifically, I have typos in one or two places and an equation is incorrect (I maximize for x when I should be maximizing for x and y). Also, my evaluation is based on very little data (though I do point out that it is very preliminary and further evaluation is needed) and the metrics I have used to evaluate the described technique do not adequately demonstrate that my method is correct or better performing. The evaluation was added after the reviewer comments and therefore was not checked.  Typos aside, as an undergrad, I was ignorant about best practices when it came to reporting results in that specific area. This is partly because me and a friend of mine wrote the paper over the summer without any involvement from our university or professors (I am not making excuses and I do hold myself accountable for these mistakes).  The paper is rather embarrassing since it does not really represent a significant step forward and is presented very sloppily. I love research (I'm planning a career in research) and I feel that it does not accurately reflect my current research rigor. I don't like it showing up in search results associated with my name.  What would you suggest is the best way to deal with this situation? I'm most worried (been stressing about retractions and the like...) by my lack of sufficient data and invalid metrics, as well as the possibility of future employers seeing it.  Note: I just want to point out that I do not believe that the core idea of the paper is wrong, but the way it is presented along with its evaluation.

        "answer_body": "  First of all, your situation is not so unusual: in fields where student-only publications are common (like mathematics and some branches of CS), a lot of academics have one or two publications from their undergraduate days. These publications are virtually guaranteed to be significantly worse than all of their other publications. If you don't believe it, consider the logically equivalent form: \"It is virtually guaranteed that the time you spend in a graduate program will significantly improve the research you do and publish.\"  I think a lot of people are vaguely embarrassed by their undergraduate publications: e.g. in mathematics most undergrad-only publications are in unusually undergrad-accessible fields like graph theory. But then a majority of pure mathematicians go on to study and work in much fancier fields and even (unfortunately, to be sure) to look down upon these areas. But although undergraduate publications can be embarrassing compared to later publications, they are impressive when compared to other undergraduates: a student-only undergraduate publication puts you at the head of the class.  For your paper in particular you sound more embarrassed by some slipshod details than by the work as a whole. It also sounds like you received some subpar refereeing and editorial work: in particular, asking for extra content and then not looking at the extra content is lazy. It can be surprising sometimes what apparently (and even actually, most of the time) reputable journals can publish. (You might think that each paper published in a serious journal would at least have a flawlessly grammatical title. You'd be wrong. But I digress...) What's done is done, but there's a lesson here: assuming that whatever someone else lets you publish is going to make you proud is sometimes an oversimplification and sometimes an outright error.  I would say that for the most part you should just work on feeling good rather than bad about this. The one thing that may be worth actual action on your part is **making clear to interested parties that this was an undergraduate publication**. There are some obvious clues to this for those who look. In my field (mathematics), up until very recently a majority of _graduate students_ did not publish papers, so it's rather common to see gaps of approximately five years between a mathematician's first publication and all later publications. Even a gap of a few years followed by a steady stream of publication creates that impression. You should certainly have a webpage, that webpage should certainly have a CV, and that CV should certainly clearly demarcate your undergraduate years. If you feel strongly enough about it, you could list that paper separately on your webpage / CV / publication list in a category called \"Undergraduate Papers\".  Afterthought: if you think the flaws in your paper will cause trouble to researchers in the field, perhaps fixing the paper in some way might be in order. You could post an edited version of the paper on your webpage, and if someone cites the paper you could refer them there. But ask a more experienced academic before you do this to get a sense of whether it's really necessary.  "

All this has made me want to take a break from my internship with the professor from the other university. I have barely done any work this semester and I haven't been regular at all to the meets. So I have already disappointed him considerably and I am further sad that I wasted an opportunity to learn and work under him (he is fairly popular in his field in the country).  **So how do I tactfully tell my internship guide that I would like to take a break without disappointing him further?** The reality is that I am already the weakest link in his research group, so I am worried that this will just convince him to let go of me from the group.

      "question_title": "I may have to write a bad recommendation for an underperforming student researcher in the Fall. How to avoid this without being exploitative?  ",
      "question_body": "   **TLDR** : PhD student mentoring an undergrad in super competitive field. Undergrad has an amazing non-research CV, but no research experience. He says he's motivated but got very little done in 8 months. I will have to write him a letter of recommendation in the Fall and if things continue, it won't be good. What should I do now to avoid this without pressuring him too much into doing work?  I'm an international PhD student doing Machine Learning at a top-4 US university. Last Summer I started mentoring 3 great students from my home university trying to create a win-win: I teach them about research and ML and help them get a paper to have a chance at entering a good grad school (ML is so hot it's now super hard), and I get help from top, motivated students and improve my mentoring skills. Before that, I had already mentored 10 students from the US university with the full range of success: from students that stopped coming after a couple of months, and 3 others that published with me, applied to grad school, and got into another top-4.  The plan with these 3 students was to work virtually (everything is virtual in 2020-21) and I would try to bring them as visiting students once we could show something to my PIs. Out of the 3 students, one is doing amazing work and we invited him to come this summer and another realized he didn't like research and quickly dropped out. In a way, both are good endings.  The third student is essentially the perfect undergrad: won gold medals in multiple national olympiads, top 1-3 in his promotion while doing 2 separate degrees in Math and CS, and winning international CS competitions in undergrad. However, you now need research to get into a top university in ML.    * During the Summer, the student and I were meeting 5x per week and he did a bit of progress, but much less than I expected and a bit below the average of the students I've mentored. In particular, I gave him a concrete project which I was hoping to submit on a September deadline and it's now February. I avoided telling him _anything_ because he's doing it for free: no credits, no money, just for the CV. He didn't realize he hadn't performed well during the Summer until I told him much later.   * In the Fall he got close to nothing done even though we were meeting 3 times a week. In November I told him: \"Hey, we're not making progress, maybe we should stop working together. We're losing our time and I would like the project to be completed since ML moves very fast.\". He told me he's very motivated and he'd put more hours in. Didn't happen.   * In January the subdepartment of my home university where I studied contacted me: I had previously convinced my PIs to bring one student to do a final degree project. This subdepartment has gained an international reputation and now has lots of spots all over top places for students to go. They do a matching so that students with the highest GPA get to choose where they go first. Because the non-working student has a top GPA he got to choose me. So next Fall he's coming to do paid full-time research with me. This also \"guarantees\" that one of my PIs will write him a letter based on my first draft.   * In February, he asked me for a letter for a fellowship. I told him I couldn't write him a very good letter. He said he hadn't really understood that getting into grad school implied having good research, not just good GPA and Scientific extra-curriculars, where he was indeed investing a lot of time. So we agreed I would write that he had lots of potential, but he hadn't had much time because of all his academic commitments. This was indeed 100% true and maaaybe good enough for the fellowship, but it's not going to cut it for grad school. He told me he realized that he hadn't done much and he would now devote 20h/week. Spoiler alert: hasn't happened. In the meantime, the idea I gave him is stuck, terrible in a rapidly moving field, and it's increasingly likely he won't have anything published by the grad application deadline.  Having now mentored 15 students, I'm pretty confident I'm giving him reasonably easy work. I've kept simplifying and concretizing and for the last few months, it involved just something slightly more complicated than the introductory 1h Deep Learning tutorial. I once tried myself to make progress on what I was asking him and got more done in 2h than him in 2 months.  I believe he thinks that because the subdepartment has many students in top places, and he's one of the best in GPA, that he'll get accepted. But, having helped with ML admissions, he doesn't stand a chance with zero papers. More importantly, right now my opinion of him isn't good and a sincere letter (which I 100% intend to write) would have to convey this. However, I've read in this community that you shouldn't write a negative letter.  Given that there are 8 months left, some of which he'll be working full time, there is time for a change. What can I do to maximize the chances of a good outcome? Some solutions involve being extremely pushy. However, I have seen what exploitative advisors can do to some friends of mine and I don't want to be such a PI. Finally, not sure if relevant context, but I'll be applying for professor myself next Fall.  ",

They are probably _exhausted_ and burnt out from all the coursework and other academic activities. The problem doesn't seem to be laziness; rather, it seems to be self-awareness: they overestimate the number of things they can do well at any given time and underestimate the importance of having successfully completed a (research) project.  The dilemma you must face is how much of this to discuss with the student.    * On one hand, it is worth making your expectations (and grad schools' expectations) clear; you don't want them to say \"I did everything you told me and got screwed\" when grad school decisions come out. And certainly, there is a limit to how much time you want to spend on a student that is not performing.   * On the other hand, forcing students to be successful undergraduate researchers is not necessarily the right thing (even if it were possible); students who have unsuccessful research experiences and end up with mediocre letters of recommendation and no publications can learn a lot in the process (both about science and about themselves).  > So next Fall he's coming to do paid full-time research with me...What can I > do to maximize the chances of a good outcome...[without] being extremely > pushy?  I have two pieces of advice. The first is to make your technical expectations clear. Presumably, you want this idea submitted to a journal by November. You can work with the student to come up with a roadmap for this, with interim milestones. For a student, seeing the long-term plan, with a concrete outcome, can be very helpful. And both of you can objectively measure the student's performance against the roadmap; there are no surprises in the fall.  The second is an attendance requirement. There is no need to change your supervision practice, but consider requiring the student to spend time physically in the building doing work each day. You may consider this pushy, but for paid, full-time research, I think it is reasonable, and has two key advantages:    * Sometimes getting started on research is the hardest part. After things start happening, the project becomes fun.   * Lots of great interactions happen between people who are physically writing code together. Certainly the student will learn more from you if you can drop by their desk and work together at the same computer. And if multiple students are working in a room together (even on different projects), they can learn from each other as well.  I'm not suggesting that the student has to do the entire project at their desk in the building, but requiring their physical presence, say, 6 hours a day for the first month or two might help break the logjam and get the project moving. And certainly it will give you a better view of the situation, which can only help your letter.  > This also guarantees that one of my PIs will write him a letter based on my > first draft.  I would consider discussing the situation with the PIs now; this brings the potential issue to their attention early, and they may be able to provide advice that takes all the individual local factors into account.

As a recommender, it is your job to decide if you want to recommend the student and to write an honest letter if you do. You may wish to give the student advice on how to improve their chances of getting into school, but ultimately it is their path.  There is nothing forcing you to write a letter. If you do not wish to do so, then you should politely decline.  If you do decide to recommend the student, your letter should focus on the positive qualities that you can speak to. It would be good to communicate to the student how much stronger your letter would be if they had more research experience. But your letter should focus on the student\u2019s accomplishments and potential that you see. As another answer has already pointed out, the student might be exhausted with all of the work that they have done; perhaps you could discuss that in your letter.  Ultimately you do not decide if the student is fit for graduate school. The admission committee will see the lack of research experience without you pointing it out in a letter. Again, it would be good to communicate frankly with the student about how much stronger their chances would be if they improved their research, but they are entitled to their own path.  "

The problem with that mindset is that your definition of a good outcome won\u2019t be the same as everyone else\u2019s. And an outcome that might appear good in the short term (e.g., getting into an ultra-competitive grad program) might end up disastrous in the longer term if it is achieved by someone who doesn\u2019t have what it takes to succeed in such a program.  So I suggest adopting the mindset that your job as a mentor is simply to _offer good mentorship_. Give good advice, give honest, accurate information about what it takes to succeed in research and to get into a good grad school, and what your standards are for writing a helpful letter of recommendation (and of course, as you yourself said, don\u2019t compromise your integrity when writing the letter). However \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cnot good\u201d the outcome turns out to be, if you did those things then you\u2019ve fulfilled your responsibilities as a mentor in the best possible way.  "

And honestly, I think that's on you. Considering the way you've sold this idea to your students, and considering the way it sounds like your student is very confused as to what you expect from him, it sounds to me like there's been a complete miscommunication (from you) regarding what this project is actually about.  If you wanted him to produce results in a summer, that should've been made clear from the get-go. But the fact that you expected results in September and yet you didn't even tell him that until February, is a clear sign that you might be the one mishandling this situation, and causing confusion due to bad communication.

And it also shows that you have been too willing to entertain promises of future work from him than you have been to insist that he call it a day.  Your post highlights so many things wrong with academic research today.  Having bright overseas undergrads sent to top US university departments for a prelude to \"research\" on a topic chosen for them rather than something they envisioned themselves and having them \"supervised\" by PhD candidates just a few years older than them is just plain foolish.  They would be far better focussing on their own final year undergrad dissertation (on a topic they devised for themselves) with constructive comment from a lecturer. That is the best way to learn how to marry novelty and monotony, harmonize imagination and rigour and extract essence from substance to produce valuable research. Many students require a Master's program to get a clear sense of this. Getting it from a Y3/Y4 undergrad is simply impossible.  From the \"amazing work\" student, you have either got:    1. A _natural researcher_ , the rare combination of intuition, intelligence and good luck; or    2. Someone sacrificing their own ideas to devote their mind to validating yours. They hope someday to attain a position where they can finally do their own thing: but this is just another El Dorado.  If I were you, I'd advise your problem student to stop this research assistance work under you to focus on his undergrad work and on _trying to find his own research perspective_ , if not _finding himself_. I sense that this chap has a way of charming people into believing in him, then using the same charm to diminish the usual consequence of letting someone down: this cannot be encouraged - it's bad for his life and for the patience of those around him.  More importantly, I would advise **you** to drop this mentoring work altogether.  A programme that selects potential researchers from a field of students who have only proven that they are good absorbers and synthesizers of knowledge found by others is not going to be successful. Experience shows that while good synthesizers may well become good teachers if they have a desire to enlighten young people, they never come up with innovative ideas by themselves - they just hijack those of others and vary the look of them. Nobody wins if you start injecting this kind of individual into a research environment. They will never leave an unsuitable work environment of their own accord - and they may well use their intelligence and charm to cause division there.  "

      "question_body": "  Yesterday I applied to a bunch of internships and sent my professor a request for a recommendation letter. He denied me the request, and sent my request email, along with his reply, to everyone in the lab. He wrote that he didn't understand why I would apply for a research internship in (our research area) when I am already a research intern at his lab, and that he assumes that I was only here for a reference letter and I have no intention of contributing to the lab.  This was shocking to me for several reasons. He had previously wrote, 2 months ago, that he was happy to write me a recommendation letter. In addition, I had already applied to a research internship in (our research area) at a national lab and he provided me a recommendation for that. On top of this, I have been working with a grad student with in-person lab work 4 days a week. I always show up on time to the group meetings but I usually don't have much to share since the grad student I work with share our results.  I also thought that it was obvious I would apply to research internships in our research area, and that it was common for undergrads to work on summer research elsewhere. I don't understand why I would apply to internships in other research areas that are not related to our lab. On top of all this, these REUs are funded and I applied because I can get paid over the summer. My position at the lab is a volunteer position.  Was this an offensive request? I'm not sure why he felt so strongly about this since he has always been very nice.  Edit: Thank you for all your suggestions. I emailed him explaining my decision and he sent the group an email saying that he values my contribution and supports my application.  ",

        "answer_body": "  To add onto other answers, especially @Buffy, I will share my recent experience as a graduate student in a similar situation. I will highlight where the conflict arose, and how you might proceed.  **The Situation**  It was about February when I started preparing an application for a well- known, although by no means 'prestigious' summer research internship/opportunity. The opportunity was directly relevant to my research area, and would undoubtedly help develop my applied scientific skills. I reached out to mentors in the opportunity, gained their support of my application, and submitted my application. Crucially, _I informed my PhD supervisor too late (I had already submitted the application)._  **Supervisor's reaction and reasoning**  The supervisor was initially very confused - why would I be seeking opportunities elsewhere when I am already in a PhD program? I believe this is a relatively common reaction among professors and supervisors - there is some expectation that the current employment is 'enough', and in many situations, it is! However, there are numerous reasons as to why a student might seek additional opportunities, such as expanding one's skillset, securing additional money for personal financial security, or _not_ having departmental funding in the summer.  **Actions I took**  Gauging that my supervisor was displeased, I immediately scheduled a meeting with them to explain my actions and, holding my ground, _why the internship would ultimately improve my research in the long-run_. I explained that this internship is temporary and would ultimately increase my success at my PhD institution. I was very direct and honest - I let the professor know how I felt about the situation, using phrases like, 'When you say X this way it makes me feel Y', such as, 'When you say, 'Why would you be seeking external opportunities, usually that is the role of the supervisor?' this way it makes me feel like I did something wrong by securing a well-known internship that would advance my career and success in the PhD program'.  Once I secured the internship, I kept my supervisor in the loop of my progress, explained what I was doing, and ultimately they felt that they were semi-participating. I also was honest and kept my word - I did not abandon the PhD program and it legitimately helped my success in my PhD research.  **Your situation (as it is a bit different)**  I would recommend you try the following things:    1. Before proceeding, ask yourself a few questions. What is your goal moving forward - to move on from this event as quickly as possible? Confront your supervisor? Secure the internship? Understanding this will help guide your actions, emotions, and self-presentation.    2. Immediately schedule a virtual meeting for as soon as possible with your supervisor. Make the intention of the meeting explicit over email, such as 'Request for meeting to discuss internship X'.    3. Before the meeting, read the many answers to SE question carefully. Many people have provided excellent insight. First and foremost, your professor has crossed a definite line by effectively publicly shaming you, and, as an adult, you should communicate how this made you feel or how it was perceived among lab mates. For example, 'When you sent an email saying X to the lab, it made me feel as though I was being publicly shamed.'    4. If your professor is unwilling to apologize/doubles down in the meeting, you may want to do some personal calculus about the situation. If you'd like to keep your supervisor, I would drop the issue. If you'd like to do the internship, explicitly ask your supervisor, \"I am intent on doing the internship but I realize that this is causing some conflict. What is the best way we can both move forward from this situation?\" Make them engage in the process. Engage them in the process.  Hope that helps, happy to expand any of my points if unclear.  "

Now, the project is finished and he wants to publish it with data that I've gathered.  The problem is, after checking my data, that the spreadsheets that I used to calculate the data are very inaccurate, to say the least. I can't remember exactly what I did, but there do seem to be some egregious inaccuracies (as in, values from the wrong dataset) in my spreadsheet compared to the raw data from the instrument either that I was colossally bad at copying data over correctly (all of the data in my spreadsheet do appear in the raw data someplace, but not necessarily in the right location, the right dataset, etc.), or worse, I'm terrified that I may have done it deliberately at the time. (How would someone be able to tell?) I did analysis with the faulty data back then and produced graphs.  Obviously, I will have to supply the correct data analysis before it gets published. But is it ok to explain it as \"I majorly screwed up the analysis and made a lot of data entry errors, here's the corrected version\"? I'm hoping that my PI will just use my corrected data and analysis and just focus on that instead trying to pore over my wrong spreadsheets to individually compare all the changes, many of which are embarrassing at best and look suspicious at worst.

I redid my data analysis with correct data entry and the results look messier on most of the things I messed up, though they do not affect the underlying trends. Not sure what this means - how likely is it for honest error to have the effect of making data look cleaner than it actually is?

I'm not sure if by \"someone\" you mean you, or the person you send this to. I can definitely imagine looking back at my own work from undergrad and doubting the integrity of it if it looked fishy. If I were trying to figure out whether I had done it intentionally, I would look for patterns in the errors (e.g. maybe treatment group is only ever misrecorded for data points that pattern against the tested hypothesis), and see if they jog your memory. I suppose that's probably what I'd do if I were trying to figure out whether someone else had done something intentional, but I seriously doubt most people would bother.  > But is it ok to explain it as \"I majorly fucked up the analysis and made a > lot of data entry errors, here's the corrected version\"?  Absolutely. You were an undergrad and it's the prof's responsibility to check your work and to ensure you know what you're doing. Also, the unfortunate reality is that lots of profs intentionally teach students in their labs to mishandle data to \"improve\" results, so that's a potential explanation here too. Because of that, I'd be more likely to say something like \"Looking back at the data now, I'm finding a lot of errors, so many that I don't think correcting them is feasible, so unfortunately I believe that this data would have to be reanalysed from scratch to proceed with the project.\" That is, tread lightly if you can't recall the origin of the discrepancies, but make your own position clear.  Also, it is absolutely not your responsibility to provide corrected data if you don't want to continue with the project. I assume as an undergrad you were either paid or volunteering in exchange for the training/experience, and I assume neither of those is true of your relationship with this PI/lab now. I recommend asking yourself whether you honestly want to continue with this project before putting any more work into this.  > I redid my data analysis with correct data entry and the results look > messier on most of the things I messed up, though they do not affect the > underlying trends. Not sure what this means - how likely is it for honest > error to have the effect of making data look cleaner than it actually is?  More likely than not. Unfortunately, we're a lot more likely to double-check steps in our work if we don't like the look of the data, no matter how thorough/neutral we might intend to be.  > If you were a professor and you were approached by a student who says that > made egregious errors on past data analysis and the corrected data looks not > nearly as good, what would you think?

Personally I trust the students that I work with or I wouldn't be working with them, so I would believe them. And I promise you, every researcher has encountered egregious errors in their past work at one point or another, often at this very stage of preparing/doublechecking for publication.  "

Undergraduate research, unlike doctoral or professional research, is usually time limited. Therefore a long term research project may be contraindicated unless your advisor agrees that partial results are acceptable within your time frame. You might not be able to reach the point of having publishable results. If that is OK, then there are no real issues.  And if it is OK, and leaves you in a place with unfinished but potentially finighable work, then there might be an advantage to it. If the research questions are sufficiently \"interesting\" and your approach is \"promising\" then you might have a head start in graduate study, depending on the requirements of any program you enter.  But, before you commit much time and effort, have that conversation with the advisor and be sure that your short term outcomes are good enough to allow you to continue.  "

Worry instead about doing _something_ useful and interesting that will earn you a nice letter of recommendation.  "

Doubly so since -- for whatever combination of reasons -- you don't seem to have extensive support from your more senior advisor(s).  If you find the funds to attend the conference and present the paper, you will turn this into an accomplishment that will be meaningful on your CV for years to come, not only to be admitted to a Masters' degree but afterwards. You will also hopefully learn a lot at the conference and begin to make contacts, which is valuable in its own right.  However, I deviate from the other answer's perspective that if you need to withdraw instead, it shouldn't appear on your CV, and would indicate lack of foresight or disrespect. This may be true for an established academic, who has or may be expected to have a stable portfolio of funding, but is not true of an undergraduate or other emerging scholar. (I hope this is true in all fields.)  If you are unable to secure funding for at least one of your team to attend to present and do need to withdraw, I think you should **definitely mention your accomplishment** (marked as \"accepted abstract at ___\" and leave it at that) on your CV **at this stage in your career, especially for the purposes of Graduate School admission**. It will help document, as you said, that you do have research experience of some sort already. Were I on an admissions committee, I would look at it favorably **in this context**.  The difference comes afterwards. I suspect that when you are job hunting **after** your graduate degree, you will censor out such an \"incomplete accomplishment\" because you will have more recent, more standard, and \"completed\" conference presentations and/or publications. While if you do find the means to attend the conference and present, the presentation will remain a line item on your CV documenting your sucessful research activity is of longer duration. This will quite likely have incremental value at that time.  There will, of course, be purists who will argue that nothing should ever make it onto your CV that will later be censored out (i.e., that your CV is a universal and evergreen list of all your accomplishments, as opposed to a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, less used in academia, which presents a subset of accomplishments chosen as most relevant at that moment for a specific purpose.) That is, perhaps, a good overall aspiration. But there are many junior academics who have at various points listed \"submitted\" or \"manuscript in progress\" items on their then-current CVs, since those were meaningful accomplishments at the time. But where for various reasons those items did not progress further, and were silently removed from the CV later.  Admissions committees get it! And they want to see whatever evidence you've got of academic and research experience **and** potential. So congratulations and good luck!  "

        "answer_body": "  **REU**  I cannot speak for all REUs, but the ones that I have experience with usually look for a few things:    * Good statement of purpose with a clear research objective. Even if this statement of purpose is a bit broad, it is important to show that you are able to ask good questions in relation to mathematics.   * Good letters of recommend.   * Specific coursework requested by the REU. I always found it odd that the REU at my university would specifically say a student needed understanding of Galois Theory OR Complex Analysis OR Graph Theory, and we would have students with none of these applying.  **Internships**  Data science (DS) internships are not scarce, as long as you are willing to go anywhere in the US. They are, however, often times competitive. I would suggest that you look very broadly at many fields for data science opportunities. (I, for example, got a DS internship one time working for a company that makes marine engines). Places like Google, Amazon, Apple, will be insanely competitive. Others, perhaps will be more tractable. If you have a background in chemistry, places like pharmaceuticals (Pfizer, Eli Lilly, etc) and chemical companies (Dow, DuPont, etc.) may be of particular interest.  **Data Science as a Field**  I cannot address every possible career path for math. I know people in law, medicine, engineering, academia, data science, psychometrics, business, athletics with math degrees. Given ten people with an undergrad in mathematics, chances are high that they will work in ten different fields.  I will specifically address data science as a career. DS relies on a trident of core topics:    * Mathematics   * Statistics   * Computer Science  You need to be good in all of these. I would hear (and was given) advice to math students such as  > A math degree teaches you to think & people will hire you for you ability to > think and problem solve.  While this is true, it takes much more than a BS in mathematics (especially pure maths) to get a job in DS. You need to be competent in the trident of fields I mentioned above.  I would suggest becoming as expert as you can in PyTorch or TensorFlow, pandas, numpy, SKLearn (all in Python). I have never seen a job reject me for knowing those skills. Learning an object oriented language (Java, C++) is also helpful.  If you are also interested in chemistry, I would suggest getting a minor in it (or something else crosscutting). Read up on GANs and drug/molecule discovery. (See for example <https://thischemicaldoesnotexist.com/>) And, as I mentioned, fields like law and medicine (chemistry) are on the table.

Now, it is important to note that you will likely have to compromise some of your needs. It is possible that there won't be many professors willing to supervise you on a topic you want rather than what they want and will recommend you to join his projects/topics. On the other hand, you may find someone willing to supervise you on the topic you choose but won't provide you with close support.  Back in my undergrad thesis, I had a topic I really wanted to work with and only had one prof on the field to supervise me. I had very minimal supervision. Was it the way I wished? No. I could've gone farther if we had worked closely and if I had had someone to discuss with or to push me. Was it worthwhile? Definitely!

My CS theses are more fun because the research is a small shard of the supervisors' broader projects, and they are genuinely curious what the outcome will be.    * The topic falls within the supervisor's main experience. I did a thesis on early medieval history with a supervisor whose specialty was late medieval history, and he wasn't really able to help as much as I'd hoped for.    * They help you bound your topic both upwards and downwards. This is one of the things you need a supervisor with knowledge of the field for. They have to know when your ambitions are big enough to satisfy the thesis requirements, but also when they're becoming too big and a hazard to you actually finishing. Good research has a reasonable scope, for your abilities and requirements. But doing good scoping at the outset requires a knowledge of what's in the field that you as a student won't have, that's why you're supervised by an expert.    * They have enough time. The top professors in your department also tend to have the biggest demands placed on their time. They also have the most power and their name on your thesis or paper can give it a boost. This is a paradox. In my case the solution turned out to be the second supervisor (having two is mandatory in my institution). My second supervisor is less influential, but also not as hemmed in by external obligations so has more time/is more reliably able to make it to meetings. Having regular meetings is important.    * You get along with them as a person. You need to be able to open up to them about any problems that are holding you back.    * They're as strict as you need them to be. Sometimes you need a push.  "

I think most people would agree cold emails are the least successful way of obtaining anything, _especially_ during COVID when professors are even more overworked than they were a year ago. My point is, is if they haven't posted looking for an undergrad, they aren't very likely to have the bandwidth to add one.

Sometimes the choice of a particular statistical model used in a paper makes perfect sense, but at other times, the statistics involved is way too advanced.

The next thing to try would be to ask those professors again, but instead of asking to work with them, ask for their suggestions of a couple of people at other universities who you could get in touch with. You can do this iteratively: each time you email someone to ask for an opportunity, say that you understand if they're too busy to take on a student and ask if they have a suggestion for someone else you can contact.  Those more senior to me may weigh in on this, but it's generally frowned upon to offer your work for free. If the professor isn't able to compensate you financially, would you be able to get course credit for your work? I'm not too familiar with the US system, but perhaps it is possible. I would avoid working for free if you can -- it sets a precedent and allows professors to favour those who have their own financial support (and thus puts less well off students at a disadvantage when looking for research opportunities).  Keep studying the literature if you can, and persevere with emailing professors. To maximise your chances of a response, keep the email polite and to the point. Good luck!  "

Seeing a paper and writing \"Dear Prof. X, I saw your recent paper \"Title\" and I found this extremely exciting, this is exactly what I want to do.\" can backfire: Maybe this is _not_ what the professor is interested in, but it is just a side project, mainly driven by some other people, to which he made contributions. This might come off as you not having looked into what he/she is really interested in.  Second, you don't have to come across as overly eager, and don't try to say things just to please the professor. Most professors are reasonable and critical people, and they will not be pleased just because you try very hard to please them. What they will want to see and hear is why you contacted them, why overall you find their topic interesting and what excites you for that topic (not in detail, but, say, as compared to a completely different topic within the same field, say, experimental opics vs. theoretical high-energy physics). Being too unspecific (\"I find everything interesting\") is just as bad as being overly specific (\"Only your very topic is what I want to work on\"), but having _some_ ideas of what interests you have, and where your strenths are, is certainly a good thing.

However, I haven't done much other than coursework so far, and I'm trying to plan a productive summer (learning something new, perhaps interacting with professors). By the time summer begins, I will have completed all _basic math courses_ such as _Analysis, Abstract Algebra, Linear Algebra, Set Theory, First Order Logic, etc_. Apart from this, I've spent some time self-studying advanced topics such as Graph Theory, for example.  I think the above background is sufficient for me to at least learn about advanced math topics, if not do research at this stage. By advanced, I mean anything that would have at least one of the above topics as prerequisites, for example, _Category Theory_ or _Algebraic Geometry_.  * * *  **What do summer projects in math look like?** I believe, for the most part, these would just be directed reading projects (which is great too). **How do I find such projects?**  _Big Question:_ Would it be a good idea to **cold email** professors (ones who I've had no prior interaction with, but I really want to work with them at some point) and ask if they'd be willing to advise me on a reading project or such? I'm thinking of approaching professors at institutions different from mine - in particular, places where I'd like to go to grad school too. Would this be a good idea? I'm aware that professors are busy and they're not likely to respond to undergrad students from other institutions easily, but seems worth trying.  In addition, would it also be a good idea to reach out to postdocs or senior PhD students in math? I guess they could be good mentors for reading projects, too.  * * *  Lastly, if anyone has any other ideas for spending a productive summer in pure mathematics, do let me know!

First, it may be that your current instructors could guide you if you don't put much burden on them.  Next, they might have maintained contact with their own teachers and can introduce and recommend you to a distant university professor.  Third, you can find the course requirements online for some topic of interest to you and get a copy of the textbook. Get the syllabus if available and follow it. This will give you access to readings and possibly exercises that you can do. Do a lot of them. Getting feedback on your results will be an issue, but maybe someone local can help you.  Finally, you might consider forming a study group if you can find others who are interested and work together to learn and give each other feedback. A local professor might help you arrange such a thing and even provide minimal guidance.  "

With regard to theses (i.e., bachelor, master thesis, also PhD thesis), I don't see any issue in posting the thesis somewhere public. (Indeed, PhD thesis usually _must_ be published.) After all, your thesis is _your_ work (certainly this is the formal point of view), and it is up to you what you do with your work.  On the other hand, if you have a supervisor who wants to publish results from the thesis as part of a journal article, it might be better not not publish the thesis before that, such as to protect your ideas until the paper is out. However, this is more about being smart than about being ethical. Also, as far as I see there is no such issue involved here.  Note that the situation is different for results which are not part of the thesis, and which is not solely your work: In that case, you cannot publish them without consent of your coauthors. (Again, this is not about being illegal, but about research and publication ethics.)  Finally, even if it is fine to post your thesis, a bachelor thesis in practice often _does_ involve contributions from the supervisor, so it is probably smart to ask them for permission. As has been pointed out, they might well be happy to showcase good students. And last, since your supervisor does not seem to care much about publishing, they should not mind those ideas being publicly available (unlike when they would like to use towards for a publication).

Undergraduate theses are typically fairly short-term projects, so you may not be able to follow up with all the avenues you would have for a longer project.  Most importantly, though, **talk to your supervisor**. Their role as a supervisor is for exactly the situation you're in: applying their experience and expertise as a researcher to help guide you in what to do. If everything worked out perfectly without any kinks or setbacks a supervisor would hardly be necessary.  Also most importantly (I'm running out of superlatives here), as a student, the success/failure of the endeavor should be primarily judged on what you as the student have learned along the way rather than the overall outcome (the proverbial \"it's the journey not the destination\"). Your device may not be working, but if you've learned something along the way I would not say the project is a \"failure\".  "

If you've kept them posted on progress, and they know what you've been doing all along, then the fact that some part of this failed (perhaps you didn't allow for enough strength in a 3D print, say) is not the end of the world. You may still have proved the concept.  If you have actively lied to them about your progress though, you can rightly expect your final grade to be extremely bad.  And if you haven't been in contact with them at all for the entire year, that is a major fail from them. The purpose of having a supervisor is to guide you in the right direction with regular expert feedback. If your project has failed because of a lack of supervision, you may need to talk to your head of department about considering mitigating factors in your grade.  ### Do you know why it failed, and can you say what you would have done to improve it if you'd had more time?  That's the crux of this. The point of undergraduate projects is to practise your skills in real life, before you start using them in a real job. In a real job, things often go wrong and you need to work out how to fix them. If you can show you're picking up those skills, you should still get decent grades.  "

So basically the scenario is, I have a paper about a certain topic which I know nothing about. So I do some research on it. After reading a lot about the topic I form an opinion on it. The problem is that my opinion was formed based on reading a lot of other people's opinions. For example, I will read a lot of academics argue one thing, and I will think \"oh that makes sense, I agree!\" so when I write my paper I will be of the same opinion.  So the question is, do I have to cite the sources that led me to my opinion **when I state my opinion**?? Or phrased differently: Do I have to cite the people that agree with my opinion?  For example, if I write:  X because of Y. And this specific author also agrees with this. <\\- in this case, do I have to use in-text citation for the first sentence?? Should I write something like:  X because of Y (author, year). <\\- because I feel like in this case it does not sound like I also agree? It just sounds like I am describing what \"author\" thinks. How do I add my own opinion to this?  Please keep in mind that these are undergraduate level papers. Up until now, I have been writing entirely descriptive papers (with \"someone argues this and someone argues that\" and my grades have not been great :( ) without offering my opinion because I was so scared that it would be plagiarism to agree with someone's opinion without citing (since it may be considered to not be an **original** opinion). Again, I will cite the other authors that agree with me after stating what I think, but my question is if I have to in-text cite them **when** I state my opinion.  I am a confused and lost freshman and with the pandemic I can't even go to campus and talk to a librarian about this, so if anyone could help me I will owe you my life, thank you.  ",

Plagiarism is presenting the ideas of others as if they were your own. It is considered to be serious academic misconduct and most professors who recognize it in a student's paper will mark it down pretty severely if they accept the paper at all.  And, since you are an undergraduate, it might be especially important to get into the habit of this.  Note that you don't need to copy the words of others to commit plagiarism. It is about the ideas, not the specific words.  You can \"weigh\" the ideas of others to come to an original opinion, but you need to be specific about the sources.  And if you must err a bit on one side or the other, citing too much is not usually a problem, but citing too little always is. So, tend toward over citation, especially as you learn this stuff.  * * *  Example:  > John Smith in the July 2020 issue of International Basket Weaving asserts > ... A ... and gives the following reasons....  > In contrast, Mary Jones in the April 2019 issue of the same journal suggests > ... B ... and asserts...  > I conclude that the correct solution is B _because_...  It is the things that follow \"because\" that are your contribution.

I agree that this theory is correct.  This last sentence is a little bit ridiculous -- your opinion is altogether irrelevant (unless you are an esteemed physicist). The is true in other fields -- saying you, as a student (or even me, as a professional in a different field), agree or disagree with Mark Twain or Charles Darwin or Thomas Aquinas is almost comical.  On the other hand, facts are facts regardless of who says them, and you are entitled to an \"academic opinion\" even now. So consider, instead, this much stronger paragraph:  > Newton's laws of kinematics were widely accepted for hundreds of years, and > have been experimentally verified many times [cite, cite, cite]. However, > Einstein's recent work argues that Newtonian kinematics does not apply at > very high speeds [cite]. Recent work with cathode rays [cite] seems to > support Einstein's findings.  So in this case, you are clearly _arguing_ that Einstein is correct and Newton is wrong (i.e., \"your opinion\" is that you \"agree\" with Einstein), but you do it with facts and logical reasoning, without ever mentioning \"agreement\" or \"opinions.\"  Now you had asked specifically about making a choice -- what to do when experts disagree. Even in these cases, you can present your analysis without ever mentioning \"agreement\" or \"opinions.\" Consider:  > \"Jones argues A [cite] while Smith argues B [cite]. While there is no clear > answer, Adams makes a compelling case for B [cite], noting that _. Indeed, > in light of Adams' arguments (particularly his ontological argument), Jones' > position seems wholly untenable.  In the above, it is clear that you \"agree\" with Adams and Smith, and your claim that Adams' case is \"compelling\" is very much an opinion (one that you will need to defend in the paper). But you never use the words \"opinion\" or \"agree,\" and the citations take care of themselves.  Nor are you limited to discussing others' ideas; you can also raise your own ideas:  > \"Jones argues A [cite] while Smith argues B [cite]. While there is no clear > answer, the only verifiable evidence is the exponentially rising CO2 levels. > Recent results [cite] have only strengthened this body of evidence. Given > the extraordinary success of this prediction, Smith's position seems > superior to that of Jones.  In the second and third sentences above, you are presenting your own, novel ideas or analysis, and there is no need to cite anyone. Again, you are very clearly agreeing with Smith, and you very clearly have an opinion, but you never use those words, and the citations take care of themselves.  "

Before moving on to the main part of the question, let me describe a bit about my background in mathematics.  So, I am currently involved in a group research project on discrete geometry, which is being mentored by a renowned mathematician (of UCSD) in the US. I will also be doing a research internship on algebra under a well-known faculty of IIT Bombay in the upcoming summer of 2021. I participated in PROMYS 2020 Bridge Program (as a junior counselor and researcher) and PROMYS Boston 2019 (as a first year student) as a Mehta fellow. Also, I participated in MSP 2018, ENS Paris, as one of the top 50 young mathematicians around the world. In addition to this I am a Regional Mathematics Olympiad (RMO) awardee and have also received a high-distinction in AMC 2016, back in high school.  Now moving on to the main part of the question, I wish to pursue my graduate studies in Mathematics from the US or Europe, that is, I wish to shift to mathematics after I am done with my bachelor's degree in chemical engineering.  But, as you might know the mathematics that is taught in a typical engineering program covers real analysis, multivariable calculus, Fourier series, linear algebra, vector calculus, complex analysis, differential equations (ODE and PDE), Laplace transform, probability and statistics and numerical analysis. We are not taught abstract algebra (groups, rings, fields, etc.), most part of analysis that is covered in a typical undergraduate mathematics course and topology. So, these are the courses that would formally lack from my coursework, which would seriously make my application (for graduate studies in mathematics) weak and less competitive.  Though I will be taking five additional undergraduate courses in mathematics and computer science next semester (from NPTEL), namely, introduction to rings and fields, introduction to algebraic topology, introduction to Galois theory, introduction to algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and design and analysis of algorithms. I hope taking these courses would cover up for the lacking coursework to some extent. I plan to keep taking such additional undergraduate courses in mathematics and computer science for the further upcoming semesters too. In addition to this, I have also taken courses in Number Theory, Graph Theory and Topology during my two years at PROMYS.  I am also preparing for the GRE mathematics subject test and covering some of the undergraduate mathematics courses on my own, at the same time.  I have heard that funded masters are not a thing anymore in good US universities. So, should I be opting for an integrated PhD in mathematics from the US or should I be opting for a masters in Europe after my bachelor's? Which is easier to get into (provided my background in mathematics)? And, what else should I be doing (like more undergraduate research work, coursework, etc.) to enhance my profile in mathematics, in order to get into some decent universities?  ",

I've heard it's more important for an Econ student to do honors and it would be much more difficult for me to do research without the designated courses.

Furthermore, basically every place I apply to doesn't care whether I've done honors or not.  I joined for the learning and experiencing research in undergrad, but it seems difficult to justify when the same time/credit hours can be spent doing something else that would be more applicable to jobs (ex. taking a grad lvl deep learning course).

From your post-grad plans, I'm guessing you want to be something like a manager in a tech company. More concretely, it sounds like your next step is to get an MS in CS from a reputable school. So, you should determine which of your alternatives will help you to reach these goals. In some sense, this is a normal career decision rather than a peculiarity of academia.  **Cast a wide net.** The challenge with the above approach is that it's hard to set goals in your early career, when there may be jobs that you haven't even heard of, or things you enjoy / are good at that you haven't even tried yet. So, consider that you should try many different things and develop many different skills before you settle on a narrow path. While there are many possibilities, research is a good/common choice because:    1. Research positions are often available for college students, are usually compatible with students' schedules and levels of experience, and are easily understood (or even expected) by employers and grad schools; and   2. Most research projects are longer-term endeavors that require learning skills that are useful \"in the real world\"; so, the benefits of getting some research experience are not limited to those who want to pursue research careers.  > I'm not sure I want to do honors [in CS]. I could be taking grad courses > that go deeper into topics that interest me and can do research on the side > (ie as part of a prof's group) without those credits.  This seems like a well-reasoned decision. Here, it seems like \"getting honors\" would actually reduce your qualifications (which is a failing of your college!). Sometimes it's important to do painful things just for the accreditation (e.g., PhD candidates need to finish proofing their thesis!), but this does not seem to be one of those times.  > For Econ, I'm more concerned. I've heard it's more important for an Econ > student to do honors...however, I don't plan on going to grad school for > Econ  I suspect the comment about honors being important pertains to graduate admissions in economics, which is very competitive. I seriously doubt that getting \"honors\" in your second major would much matter in other contexts. For example, when I interview recent grads (for permanent R&D positions), we only care about their relevant experience and knowledge...even GPA is not weighted very heavily, and a lack of departmental honors would make no difference at all.

This is at a university with a top medical program. However, the data has just started being annotated and due to this, the project could take as long as 2 years (according to the faculty since CT data is pretty voluminous). There would be some periods of very less work, while some periods would need huge amounts of work in a week.  The main point of contact/research mentor would be a grad student, who in turn works under some professor. They are very experienced in the medical imaging field, but have just started venturing into AI. I have the chance to publish as a non-first author if the results are worthy of publishing.  I plan to apply for grad school right after undergrad. The possibility of publishing seems to be a great offer, but if it were to take 2 years from now to finish the project, I may not have a publication to include in my applications. I will probably have an LoR (preferably from the prof) and gained some research experience though.  My main question is: **Are undergraduate research projects on such long timescales (like 2 years) likely to stagnate and/or get abandoned?**  I'm not experienced with CT scans but 2 years seems a bit overboard to me for training and evaluating models, since most of the delay is coming from annotating the data.  PS: I do have the chance to get similar opportunities with smaller timescales later, but the potential impact of this project is high, and hence my personal liking for it  ",

This professor was one I had a fairly good relationship with, and he actually helped me be able to skip some classes which I had already self-studied. Because I enjoyed the professor, I decided I wanted to work with him and his research group. However, I have discovered that I currently do not enjoy knot theory; it's a rather esoteric subject with few resources from which I could learn it from and gain some intuitive understanding, and one needs a solid grounding in topology to do much in it (I do not have a solid grounding in topology).  Ultimately, I didn't really do much during my research (I both thoroughly disliked it and wasn't able to do much; the latter fact probably influenced the former) and when COVID-19 hit I simply fell off on researching and communication with the professor. I fully realize that both my lack of effort while researching and the actual ghosting was quite deeply wrong. I have no plans to do anything similar to my current research mentor or any future ones regardless of how the research goes, so please do not lambast me too much for this. I now do research in physics (where I am much, much happier), but I feel quite horrible for what I did to my professor. To make matters worse, I have several books on topology that I would like to return to him (on somewhat of a tangent, Munkres's books, while good, are not exactly the most stimulating textbooks I've read, so I didn't learn too much topology). I very much want to apologize for my actions and offer to return the books, but I don't know how to do so gracefully. If any advice could be granted, I'd appreciate it immensely.  ",

Knot theory is knot for everyone (ha ha!), a fact your professor is probably well aware of. Sure, it would have been nice if you had let them know earlier, but I'm quite sure they realized it during your internship.  The best thing to do now is to reach out to them, apologize for not being in touch earlier. Keep the email short and to the point, no need to write a 1000 word essay. You're likely to get a short reply acknowledging your email and that would be that.  The only point that might have genuinely pissed them off is the books you took and didn't return. Offer to return those as soon as you can, at your expense.

That alone may make it worth the fee (and I am increasingly adopting books available on this platform as the textbooks for my courses, so students can access them for the flat fee of an ACM student membership). You should check if you can get a membership without the DL - US students can, and the digital library is the only difference (non-DL memberships still include the O'Reilly platform, for instance). In my opinion, O'Reilly alone makes it worth the fee.  As you progress in your research, the discount for conference attendance also becomes useful. Many ACM-sponsored conferences require students to be ACM members in order to get the student discount (in part because asking the ACM \"is this person a student member?\" is a lot easier than verifying individual proofs of student status).

Many people who have judged me as the stupider scientist and talked down to me couldn't make it in the field, so I wish I hadn't put so much weight on what they said at the time.  If you love the work, keep at it. Doing something you're passionate about for an undergrad degree is hardly a waste of time, even if you ultimately have to go a different route.  Keep a plan B in your back pocket. The nice thing about academia is the hiring timeline is usually a lot earlier than industry, so if you don't get into grad school/get the next level job, you still have a few months to pivot into an industry search. Depending on your financial situation, you may need to pursue both options simultaneously to avoid he risk of being unemployed, but it's doable. As long as you like the work/the lifestyle and you still have options, keep at it.  Also there are lots of professors out there with opinions, so don't just select one at random to decide your fate. Actually the bar is way lower: if you can find one person who believes in you at the undergrad level, that's enough, even if everyone else says you're no good. Later on in your career, shoot for at least three senior people who think you're great. Ignore the rest of the noise.  But an academic career can be hard at times, especially for the people that aren't flying through prestigious institutes with a ton of encouragement and no pushback. If you approach the career the way I'm describing, it will be really hard at times. If you find the work and lifestyle worth it, keep going, but the reality is that the lifestyle is not easy and there's no shame in leaving for a more comfortable life.  "

The fact that my adviser thinks it is publishable and may make an impact in the field is rare enough in undergrad, while the grad student I am working with is not sure what exactly he's researching yet - and I fear that he will look into using X now, which might cross with my research.

For research it should not matter very much at all which degree you have as long as you manage to convince the person in charge of the research group (group leader / professor) that you will be of value for his research.

When I read the title, I thought it was going to be that you're applying to mathematics but published in biology, or something like that. After reading the question I've learned that you've published a number theory paper in a small local journal, and may publish a paper heavy in functional analysis, and you want to apply for a PhD in set theory/logic. These aren't \"completely\" different fields, they are all mathematics subjects and there is always some overlap.  Having a publication, no matter what the field, does show at least a bit of aptitude for research, and that you have experience in academic research and publishing. Not all undergraduate students that get into prestigious PhD programs have publications (though it certainly would help). Even fewer will have a publication in precisely the same field as their PhD.

I came up with a feasible research idea for my thesis and I want to work on it mostly independently however, I never published before so I want to increase my chances by getting some guidance. There are two professors at my school who work in my domain. But there are two potential problems:    1. The professor who's work most closely relates to my research interests said he will not be advising undergrad students until the Spring. I just finished up at another research lab. I discovered that a lot of people are interested in this specific topic I am researching, and it's applications (I am focusing on an application of it). I would rather get started sooner than later. **TLDR;** cited ~900 times, publishes in the specific domains I am interested in, assistant professor, graduated 10 years ago    2. The other professor said he will advise me starting now but, he publishes mostly in robotics journals. Now, the research I am doing is robotics related, but it is more machine learning related. I would want to publish in conferences or journals more related to ML than a pure robotics journal. if you're not in CS, you may ignore this part: He mostly publishes in The International Journal of Robotics Research, while I am aiming for JIPC, Artificial Intelligence, NeurIPS, and The Journal of Machine Learning Research for this paper. The other professor has published in these ~8 times. This professor has published in JIPC and AAAI once or twice. **TLDR;** cited ~ 5000 times, publishes in mostly one domain, does not publish in conferences I'd like to see my work in often, but still publishes in what looks like reputable places, associate professor, graduated <10 years ago  I am not sure what would be more beneficial. I don't have the opportunity to work under a super famous professor, so it looks like another way to get my research out there would be publishing in more \"popular\" journals.    * Is it worth the wait to work with the other professor in the Spring? I was thinking I could tell him my topic now, ask if he would at least confirm it is feasible, and write up a white paper this fall in preparation for Spring.    * Or, should I get started because this is a very hot subject and I shouldn't let months of valuable research time get by?    * should I try to get a professor who is more well known at a different uni to advise me?

Go check out the journal Acta Astronautica for just one example - it is a journal about technologies and techniques for space exploration. Many of the articles outline advanced space mission concepts and are done entirely in simulation, both because it is expensive (thus there is no budget to launch, say, 100 missions to Mars) and because an important part of engineering is the simulation and prediction of system performance.  However, there are other fields in which this is difficult, but not necessarily impossible. It depends on the fidelity of your simulation. A paper with a poorly made simulator that makes too many assumptions is likely to get rejected.  And this does bring me to a central part of this answer: you need SOME kind of results. I spoke a lot about simulation, but there are other types of papers in which things like architectures or organizational plans are written about and (sometimes) accepted. But ultimately, like the comments say, you can't just give an idea of what it would be like if you could do it.

Another answer discusses [the ethics of working for free](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/154667/22768) and argues that it benefits the privileged who can support themselves. Some good points are raised and I've upvoted that answer. I don't entirely agree though: Sure the privileged benefit, but the unprivileged do to. Only they do so at greater cost. Perhaps working two jobs, minimising expenditure, or racking up some debt. Ultimately, refusing unpaid interns deprives the unprivileged of a levelling-up opportunity.  "

The system of unpaid internships in law, media, politics etc, has long been seen as a source of the unrepresentativeness of those professions and research is no different.

This is true even more so if you are going to cold-email people. Professors get lots of such emails.

Thus, you want to have a CV where the relevant information is quickly to find and which is easily accessible.  The template you mention seems to me, at least in the two-column version with two completely independent columns which seems to be the standard one, impossible to parse quickly - one never knows which column to look at. So people might not find the information they are looking for or, worse, overloop it, since they don't know where to look for it and parse the right column only.  So I think it is important how you format your CV, especially if you are going to cold-email people. It should be formatted such that it is very easy to find relevant information - publications, education, and so forth. To this end, I think a single-column layout with clearly visibe captions is suited best. Beyond that, the \"fanciness\" of the actual layout is indeed not relevant.  "

A scientific research article is written in a different way to most other types of articles, so you would be getting mentorship in scientific writing. Without this mentorship you may have much more difficulty in getting the paper accepted due to your unusual writing style, the fact you will likely place emphasis on the wrong things and leave that you may leave out key points that the readers need to follow.  Your supervisor also knows the field better than you, and so knows if this is a publishable result, or if you will need to do some checks/extensions. They may also realise that your method may be an extention of some other method or an application of a method to a different field (even if you didn't know of the method before). That may give some insight to the result and/or make it fit more snugly into existing literature. It may also turn out that your result was published last year, or ages ago in some out of the way place, which your supervisor may be more aware of.  There are also money/grant aspects to consider. Money may be involved in getting it published (though it might also be possible for the university to have some money, but they probably expect post-docs/advanced PhDs to be requesting it). I have also heard that computer science papers are normally published by going to a conference which will have expenses. If you got some money from a grant your supervisor may wish to say that this is an output of that grant so they can include it in reports and it may look weird not to have their name on it (shouldn't really be reason for name on a publication, but might be useful if trying to understand any behaviours).  All in all: probably go co-authorship, but view it as a mentorship in how to write academically and instruction in how this work fits into the broader picture. However you can discuss with him about being a corresponding author (which may indicate you are more than just an undergrad doing plug and chug who got lucky). Furthermore when you get a reference from him you can ask him to explicitly point out how you took initiative and went beyond what was expected, resulting in this paper.  "

Good grades, good letters from your professors, all contribute to a larger picture.  If any of your professors studied in the places you are contemplating, you might ask them for advice. Sometimes the personal contacts between professors can have an effect, depending on the admissions system. At a minimum, a letter from someone trusted by the reader has more impact than it would if there was no such relationship.  Make sure your CV is complete and, very important, make sure that your SoP talks about your future career goals and how you intend to pursue them. Any ideas you have about research projects can help, though less detail is probably a good thing. If you aren't a native speaker of the language of the country you apply to, make sure your materials are checked by someone who is so that the language is correct and not misleading or awkward.

If I recruited a student, they would stand to gain:    * Practice in conducting data extraction for articles for a systematic literature review   * Practice manuscript preparation   * Authorship (nb: if it leads to an accepted publication)   * etc...  When I was an undergraduate, I greatly appreciate the opportunity to participate in the research process. However, I was paid for the contributions (in both cash and credit-hour situations). I feel extractive utilizing labor that is volunteered. I have spent considerable time trying to find an in-house university scholarship/funding source for this activity, but to no avail.  While I realize this system must have been vetted and supported by numerous academics with research experience, I feel strange using it. Is it ethical to use this volunteer system? Or should I simply put more time into finding a funding source for the student?  I was also considering setting aside part of my PhD salary for the undergraduate student, but I realize this has tax and legal ramifications beyond my knowledge.  * * *  Updates from initial comments:  In general, I agree with the answer posted by @AnonymousPhysicist [here](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/109882/should-professors- pay-undergraduate-students-doing-research-in-their-labs).

PS: I contacted my instructor after the cancellation if it was possible to conduct it in a remote mode, but after the consideration he rejected it because of the difficulty of doing research remotely. So I have not done anything about the program  Many other people must have encountered the same cancellation in various programs, and some of my peers in the program have the same questions. I hope to hear a good instruction on the issue, thanks.  ",

Now, since I still had a few months till I start with my master's, I thought of continuing with the work that I did for my bachelor's project (also partly because I had not been able to fully achieve what I had planned; various reasons but mostly due to lack of time and guidance required for an area in which very less prior work has been done).  I have done a significant amount of work in these few months and want to mention it in my CV.

The worst case is that you will get a lot of offers with a wide net, but no offers at all with a narrow one. Stay flexible.

      "question_body": "  I started my own research (sub) group in a STEM field some months ago at an EU university (bachelor/master/PhD system). Every student has to do a bachelor's thesis (6 weeks), research internships (total of 6 weeks), and a master's thesis (6 months). Since I believe that introducing students to actual research early is beneficial, I use these to let students work on part of my own research. This also allows me to care more about their work.  However, almost no female students show interest in doing their research projects in my group. I don't think it's because of me as person, since in the past almost 75% of students I supervised were women, most of them approaching me with the desire to work with me. However, I switched from an experimental research focus to a theoretical one and I require students to have some basic understanding of programming, since it's necessary for the research I'm doing now. I strongly suspect that this is the factor that leads to this problem.  Given the short time of many of those internships I don't see it as an option to teach these skills in that time in addition to the other necessary skills I have to convey. The university has coding courses and even special courses only for women, however, they don't seem to be very popular.  Any good ideas how I could motivate female students to pick up a basic knowledge in programming (either in the university provided courses or \"on their own\") and not being scared off by this requirement?

      "question_title": "Publishing Unpublished undergraduate research after a decade  ",
      "question_body": "  I want to see whether I can publish my undergraduate work after a decade.  **Context:**  This is to support my academic career as I am planning to apply for a PhD program (Biophysics/Chemistry/Structural biology) in the US soon. I do have an MA from a highly ranked Public Ivy (mastered out from PhD due to health issues). I am targetting a few very competitive programs.  The last two years of my career are a bit productive. I got two coauthor papers this year (Angewandte Chemie, Analytical Chemistry). Most probably get two others (Science, Angewandte Chemie). Around 15 conference abstracts published (citable). But on papers, my name is in the middle as I am just a research tech (except conference abstracts where I am the first and presenting author for most).  Thus, I am not satisfied as I don't have any first-author papers. Then I realized that I can publish my undergraduate work.  In my undergraduate research, I synthesized a novel hydroxamic acid hexadentate ligand and then carried out a speciation study of its iron (\u0406\u0406\u0406) complexes using UV-Vis spectroscopy. Only one type of ligand-iron (\u0406\u0406\u0406) complexes was revealed in spectroscopic studies. Then I was supposed to verify my results by using MD simulation. I have not completed this part. However, I can complete this now.  I did this work a decade ago and only submitted my thesis to fulfill a degree requirement. However, I believed no one synthesized the compound after that.  I am interested to know how to go and determine    1. work is publishable in quality    2. If it is good enough, how should I proceed to finish up the work and publish it?    3. Also, whether I can file a patent for this compound (I can find some useful application for the compound)  Another objective for doing this is to learn the process of publishing a first author paper and process of filing a patent rather than going after any commercial interest.  I got my undergraduate degree in Sri Lanka, and my PI never bothered to publish the work or file for a patent as he does not have an active research group. Moreover, most professors in Sri Lanka are only interested in teaching.  I appreciate any advice on this matter.  * * *  Update #01  Thank you @buffy  My priority is to get a first author paper out before the 2021 application session starts ( At least submit it). The patent is secondary, but I would like to get it to strengthen my green card application.  The department I work for now helps with patent filing, and they have dedicated staff for that matter.  My biggest issue right now is to find someone that can assess the quality of the work. My current PI is busy and often delay answering to my questions related to current work. So I do not have high hope there.  Also, I am mostly doing biophysics/physical chemistry/analytical chemistry/Biochemistry related work now. Thus regarding this particular work, I am not sure how to judge the quality or which journal to target.  ## Would it be appropriate to email a few professors that do similar work for guidance?  Update 02  Thank you @kosmos I have contacted my supervisor and previous collaborators. I am waiting for their response. I will see where people published similar work and go from there. I am not interested in paying someone to proofread; instead, I would like to get an idea about the quality of the work. My current research is on the modulation of G-Protein\u2013Coupled Receptors (GPCRs) by soft membrane matter. Thus, I have minimal exposure to physical organic chemistry to answer that question myself.  ",

You also need to know if the university is the proper party to file the patent. They may have rules about that, which you implicitly agreed to earlier. And patenting can be an expensive proposition, require advice from a patent attorney.  If you intend to publish, you need to determine whether others should be co- authors, and, if so, get them involved. Be careful of issues of plagiarism here if others contributed.

But as pointed out in another answer you must talk to your previous collaborators and ask for their permission to include their name if they are interested, or otherwise.  The same applies for a patent. You cannot own it by yourself if there are other collaborators. You would need a patent lawyer and it will cost you money, both for the lawyer and patent fees. Also, your Sri Lankan PI might have other issues, e.g. his university might not allow him to own a patent as they might claim that the work came out of using their resources, which I believe should be the case.  As for getting your paper proofread, you could get that service for pay. I believe there are many freelancers providing that service. You can consider that option, though personally I never did that and I do not prefer it. Since your previous PI does not try to get his papers published it is unlikely that he would be able to do a good job in supporting you even if he agreed to.  Look for the impact factor of the conferences and journals to learn about their quality. And then look at the papers in those journals to gauge the quality of your work. Check if any Nobel laureates or famous chemists have got their papers published with them. It should be fairly easy to determine the quality of the publisher. I generally send my paper to a target journal/conference which is best to start with. If it gets rejected, depending on the comments I downgrade it to the journal of poor quality or keep persisting with quality journals if I get good reviews. Though I do not study in your area, I believe the same process could work for you.  As you might already know this process of getting published requires time and patience, so if you need it by 2021 you must hurry up. Quality journals/conferences take a lot of time to get back to you.  Best of luck!  "

      "question_body": "  I'm looking to complete a senior thesis (I would also want to do other research, but I doubt the viability of this) as an undergrad and I need help understanding how I would go about choosing the research advisor.  I am not really looking to do a masters/PhD as of right now, although this may change in a couple years. As of right now, I plan to go into the commercial market after college and would like to optimize for this.  Talking to some people in the workforce, I was told it would be very helpful to have a good thesis with an advisor that is well-known (high status) in the field. However, this seems to go against the prevailing sentiment on this site ([1](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/130800/126356), [2](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/28843/126356)). Why is it better to find a new prof rather than using a well-known prof?  Another problem is that undergrad research seems to be very infrequent (so there are maybe only 1 or 2 people I can ask about any specific prof [a la this suggestion](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/28843/126356)), so sampling bias is a large concern.  The third, and perhaps greatest concern, is I'm not sure what subfield I would like to work in (finishing all the lower division courses taught me almost nothing of actual use about the field, as there was a lot of hand-holding in those courses). Talking to some other students who went through this before me, I have heard that one should take a class with the professor before asking them to be one's research advisor (I thought this was BS and tried reaching out to profs, but got stonewalled - this seems to be systemic in my uni/dept). This only gives me a couple terms to take classes with different professors, trying to select classes where I get to both explore the field and get a good prof to research under. However, professors that tend to be more famous tend to teach more specialized classes where I don't get to explore as much. I am ok with pushing by GenEds out to take more classes in my major and explore right now, but am unclear on how to proceed beyond just choosing something that has an interesting title, hoping I'll like one of the 4 shots I have, and running with the best of the lot.

If you don't even know what subfield you're interested in, it's hard to write a convincing email explaining why you're interested in their work.  Mentoring an undergraduate is a time _investment_ , not a time saver. So professors like to see motivated students who understand the problems they work on in their lab, which is part of the answer to your question below.  > Why is it better to find a new prof rather than using a well-known prof?  Some people might say that older professors are busy as heck, and a newer professor might have more time to invest in a promising undergrad. Unfortunately, with COVID, finding a professor with time for an undergrad will be harder.  However, this isn't universal, and you should talk to previous students before assuming a professor is a good or bad mentor.  **In summary,** identify a few top professors, take their classes (as was suggested), and do well. That's at least a foot in the door to open the conversation.  "

What your nephew should do now is just settle in and wait, and don't bother emailing the editors. As a commenter said, one month is not nearly enough time for a journal to process and review an article. It's usually more like 3-4 months and could possibly go longer than that. And the editors of these journals probably get so many emails from authors requesting status updates that usually those emails are simply ignored -- or if you have a nice editor there'll be an automated reply that says, in so many words, \"Please stop emailing me.\"   The frequent emailing could even backfire. Recently I submitted an article to a journal, with a student co-author, and was told they'd get back with me in 9-12 weeks. Six months passed and I had heard nothing. I emailed the editor and asked to make sure she had everything she needed (= polite way of bugging her for an update). The editor said she would check with the reviewer. _One day later_ I received the review -- a three-line rejection letter that indicated clearly that the reviewer had not even read the article. To me, there is a strong likelihood that the article was rejected directly because the reviewer was annoyed at being bugged. This is clear malpractice, but what are you going to do about it? Welcome to our wonderful academic publishing culture.  So, tell your nephew to move on to his next project and let this simmer on the back burner until the end of the summer.  "

That said, some of the larger graduate departments may receive several hundred applications per year, and it may be necessary to do a preliminary screening before deciding which applications will be examined in further detail. However, what gets through such a screen can vary strongly from school to school and department to department. For instance, if you're at a school whose alumni regularly go on to graduate schools and have a track record of success, that can also be a \"plus\" factor. If you're near the top of your class, that can also mitigate \"weak\" grades somewhat (because it indicates that your school resists grade inflation).  I would hope that graduate admissions flag applications with publications listed, but it depends on whether or not the database reports that summarize applications actually can do a screen for the presence of publications.  Your specific case, however, is unfortunately in the \"no man's land\"\u2014not a clear \"read no matter what,\" but also not an automatic \"throw away,\" either.

I am not in mathematics but in my research days we received requests from private individuals not uncommonly. Usually those individuals were representing themselves as entrepreneurs and they worked with us through their company, but if my advisor were to get a request to do research with potential rights to publish, and it would bring in some funding commensurate with the amount of work, we would take it whether it was a company or an individual.  So, to your point of \"professors are busy and won't listen no matter how much money I offer\", I think that's not true. However, don't waste their time. Presuming you are in the US or Canada, a professor can make up to and exceeding $100 per hour. You need to realistically assess how much work they need to do and then make it worth their time. If they need to do a few hours worth of work and will be paid $500, either personally or to their research accounts, that might not be very attractive. If you are offering a few thousand for a collaboration that doesn't take up their entire working life, you are probably going to get more responses.

At least, unless you are somehow quite wealthy, and if that was the case, I suppose you could simply pay for enrollment at another university. Let me try and clarify a bit.  As a researcher I get many requests from people who want me to look at their particular problem. This ranges from    * Fellow researchers who want to discuss - I most often oblige (at least if I have time, and their request is interesting or relevant).   * Students who I don't know in advance, who wants guidance - I help if their question is well researched and not too polemically phrased.   * Students from my own institution, not under my supervision - I always help, as this is my job.   * Amateurs who have invented the a new method or theory for something, and wants it checked - I rarely do more than skim it.   * etc. etc. etc.  You are in the last category. If you are to convince me that I should prioritize your request over the others, then I should be immediately convinced that your idea is really something special. My field is not mathematics, so I can't tell here. But judging from comments from professional mathematicians, neither can they. The second option you mention is money, and this is where I think you need to be fairly rich. If a purely monetary argument should convince me to push you to the top of the stack, you would need to pay me the equivalent of my going rate when doing freelance work, around 200 \u20ac/hour.  My best bet is to either:    * Try and get re-enrolled into a university. There people get paid to answer your questions.   * Try and find someone who would be really interested in your specific problem, and write them.   * Undo whatever you did to get banned at math stackexchange, and try again there.

Of course you need to look around to see if others have already published whatever ideas you come up with. Maybe the intersection of a couple of related papers.  Another way, for a beginner, is to have a guide. In graduate study you normally have an experienced advisor who should be more adept at coming up with problems for students to work on.  The third is also hinted in your question. Find a group of like-minded people and work together with them. This \"circle of collaborators\" is a powerful technique.  Eventually you get more experienced and are able to follow up leads from your own past work. Maybe now you are ready to be an advisor.  "

Would he view this attempt to do research under him as desperate? Or would he appreciate the opportunity to have an extra research assistant?  I know that the answer would depend on the professor himself, and on my relationship with him, but how do professors in general feel about students coming up to them and asking to be a part of their research?

So I don't think it's a problem for you to discuss the possibility of doing the \"internship\"; your university may even offer an opportunity to get course credit for it as an \"independent study.\" However, you should be prepared for the possibility that the professor feels you're not quite ready for the work\u2014but he may definitely suggest ways to overcome that deficit.

For context: I'm a computer science PhD student at a large United States research university. At my school, most professors are bombarded with emails and requests from undergraduates (in addition to, of course, PhD and masters students, and postdocs). Indeed, my PhD advisor told me that he/she gets about one email _each day_ from an undergrad requesting research opportunities.  I've worked with roughly 20 undergraduate researchers to some extent. About half of them got in our lab by emailing PhD students, who then recommended him/her to the professor if the undergraduate's resume exceeded a certain bar. The other half emailed the professor directly, but often in those cases, the professor ended up forwarding the undergrad's resume to the PhD students. While I don't have hard statistics on what this is like throughout my entire department (let alone university) I think this is a common strategy that students pursue, and the one I would begin with if I were back in my undergraduate days.

Almost exactly a year ago I asked a professor I had as a freshmen (I'm a junior now) about joining a research team. I was very surprised when he messaged me back with \"Come see me.\" Keep in mind, this professor is very old (in his 80s) and foreign born, so he's not the best at communicating in general with me. After sending me home with some totally unrelated papers he worked on in the 60s and 70s, he essentially told me that he'd find something. Well, about a month passed and nothing, so I messaged him again and he said he found something.  He put me with a PhD student working on something that sounded familiar and understandable from digital logic class. Well, we get started and this grad student is very nice. He runs me through some fundamentals of what I need to know. The important part of this is that he _never_ tells me what we are actually working on. The next 6 months of my life turn into studying abstract algebra textbooks, not electrical engineering. I get sent packages of like 15 assorted research papers that look like complete gibberish to me. But whatever, I keep pushing onward.  Well, weeks turn into months and I start to lose motivation because I feel like I am left in the dark. I tell this grad student all the time that if there's any meetings I can go to to please invite me, but I never really get anything back. He finally gave me a _vague_ idea of what we are doing about 6 months in. He seems to have either forgotten about me or just doesn't care. I feel like I am absolutely useless to this research. This further perpetuates me not wanting to even try to hike this mountain. I'm the kind of person that can accomplish great things if I feel like I have guidance. I don't know if he feels like I am incapable or doesn't want my name on his research paper. I am a first generation college student, so all of this is very new to me.  The last I spoke to him was right before spring break where he said he'd send me some materials, then this pandemic hit and I haven't heard from him in like 4 months. Any advice what I should do? I emailed him today and still haven't gotten a response. That old professor that got me the research retired this semester.

There are no classes that really delve into the exact research that the professors I would like to research with do, although the class I am taking next semester covers the _basics_ of what the group is about.

Mine would be different from the person in the next office, certainly.  You need to solve the communication problem before you can get anything specific. I suggest that you might want to contact the department office (or chair) and explain that you are having trouble contacting the professor in question and ask for advice.  But there are a couple of things you can do. You say you have already taken the courses that this group normally teaches and probably represents their interest. Normally, I'd advise doing what you have already done. So, I'll assume that you are basically prepared. But you haven't indicated whether any of them are actually interested in supervising undergraduate research. Perhaps it is a very rare thing with them. And you aren't known to them in any case, not having taken the key courses with anyone in the group.  Perhaps your attempts to contact them have been ignored for some reason or combination of reasons. But you might consider the following:  Write up a simple CV, describing the relevant courses you have taken and any research you have done around those topics. This should be a page or less.  Write up a simple SoP (Statement of Purpose) saying what you might like to do and how you think you would be successful doing it. This should be (perhaps) half a page.  You don't want to say too much, or you'll be ignored again, but you need to make an introduction to them. It is hard now, with the pandemic, but the ideal way is to go visit in person and deliver these two documents.  A third thing you might do is get a letter of recommendation from the professor you took the key courses, in which that prof introduces you to the others.

My Job was to code experiments, manage the data gathered and to write/modify the scripts to evalute these datasets. I was employed for the work of a PhD. student but I have simply became the programmer guy of the whole Lab and made diverse scripts and experiments for many people in the Lab. People were really happy with my work and everything was working fine.  I quitted the job because my PhD. advisor refused to write me as a contributor even though I worked there for 18 months. Also I wasn't learning new stuff, so I wanted to get into a new Lab, that can challenge me to learn new things. I told them, that I quit because I want to find a new job which fits my future working field better. We have currently no problems with my advisor or any other person in the Lab.  But after I quit, I asked for a Recommendation Letter from my advisor, with the expectation that he will ask Professor to write it. But instead he sent me an e-mail telling that he will write it himself.  My concern is, after spending 18 months in a Lab with a work on around 15 different projects, 5 different papers and for 10 people, I get no contribution and get only a recommendation letter from a PhD. student, which has no weight in Academia. For the new Institutes, this may look like I was a bad student research assistant, who was almost useless.  My question is am I right with my concerns? Do I have to contact Prof. for my contributions and a Recommendation Letter without telling it to my advisor? I have simply no experience in this field, but I want do a PhD. degree in future and I am worried that, this kind of thing might be a waste of time for me or even worse, a bad impact for my future.

In others only one person or the main contributors to the actual concepts presented. So, it is impossible to judge in your case without knowing more about the specific academic culture.  But as a minimum you should probably be acknowledged in some statement within the paper itself.  I'm guessing that in your case the professor isn't being mean or unethical, but the field is just such that \"authorship\" has a specific meaning that may not apply to you. If you work pretty much under the direction of someone else, then you may not actually \"deserve\" co-authorship.  I'll note, however, that there are papers in some fields, such as high energy physics, in which the list of authors is longer than the paper itself.  But note that this is a very controversial subject.  The other issue of who writes your letter of recommendation is separate. In general if you have had little contact with the professor then they know little of your work and can hardly make a prediction about your future success. The PhD student might actually be better, provided that the letter is properly written. As a minimum, the professor should review and approve the letter (IMO). It is also possible that this is field dependent and thus it may be that whoever reads your LoR will be in the same field and understand the conventions. Math might be quite different from biochemistry, for example.  * * *  To respond to your comment, I suggest that if there is a dispute among lab members about whether you should be a co-author, that you let them resolve it on your behalf.

This would also explain why they didn't ask for your data or notes, and why they have since hired new undergraduates. If this is the case, this PI would probably not be a good choice when asking for letters of recommendation.  At any rate, to your questions:  > I'm not sure if maybe my project as a undergrad wasn't that important, or if > I was unprofessional.  If they wanted your data or notes, they should have asked for them. I assume there was no directive that you failed to follow, such as \"upload your results to the portal every week.\" So no, I don't think it was unprofessional.  Why didn't they ask for your data or notes? Two possible reasons:    * In my experience, first-time undergraduate researchers do things _literally_ hundreds of times slower than I can. So, I would likely start from scratch rather than trying to turn the student's product into something useable. Of course, this will vary by field -- I can imagine that some \"wet labs\" have very time-consuming processes for which undergraduate data would be valuable (if we trust the undergraduate).    * Everyone always has more ideas than they have time. If an idea gets consigned to an undergraduate, it's probably not very high-priority. So, it could be that no one is pursuing that idea, or that a new undergraduate will start from scratch on it.   > Would it be late now, more than a year after I left, to send in data?  Personally, I would not offer. As noted above, this is unlikely to be useful; further, it raises the question of \"if you thought I needed this, why didn't you provide it a year ago?\"  > I was hoping to ask the PI for letters of rec for grad school but I haven't > spoken with him for a while and I'm not sure if I left a bad impression when > leaving the lab  I wouldn't worry about not having spoken with him in a while -- everyone is busy. And I wouldn't worry about the data/notes situation. But I would think carefully about the circumstances under which you left the lab -- generally, we don't fire students if we think they deserve a very strong recommendation.

Note that research includes the choice of the problem, the choice of methodology, the data collection and analysis, the evaluation and interpretation of results, and writing and editing of the paper. If you were helped/advised on any of these aspects, your collaborators also deserve to be acknowledged or included as authors. In some areas it is also customary to include/acknowledge the person responsible for provision of lab facilities.  Whether or not you should be the first author or some of your collaborators depend on your relative contributions to the research. Ideally, this should've been discussed in early days of your collaboration, not after the paper is ready for submission. Nevertheless, if you believe that your contribution is the most significant, you can argue to be the first author. Good luck.  UPD: In response to your comment regarding whether or not it can be a **rule** that an UG researcher can not be the first author. There is an established notion of authorship, which you can find e.g. on [Nature website](https://www.nature.com/nature-research/editorial- policies/authorship):  > Each author is expected to have made substantial contributions to the > conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis, or > interpretation of data; or the creation of new software used in the work; or > have drafted the work or substantively revised it...  As you can see, this definition is linked to contributions to research, not to seniority, etc. Most credible universities adopt this approach to defining authorship.  However, different areas have different traditions regarding the first authorship. For example, in my area (mathematics) it is (was) customary to put all authors alphabetically, which often played against me as my surname is in the second part of the alphabet.  Nevertheless, the rule that an UG researcher can not be the first author seems unfair to me. It is appropriate for you to try to establish what are the terms of reference for this rule and try to challenge it. Try to find a person responsible for research in your university (e.g. Research Office) and ask their support on it.  "

Addedum 2:  From your comment to @Dmitry's answers, I suspect that your mentor either lies or s/he is very young and doesn't have much experience. In such a case, I would advise you to discuss the issue with other (more established) faculty members in your department who also work in the same field.

Of course I cannot speak for every journal in your particular subfield, but rejecting papers only because of the academic rank of the first author would be ethically dubious. At the very least, there are some [megajournals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mega_journal) that do not have such criteria and which should accept your work \u2013 given that it is scientifically sound, etc. (Mind that I am not saying that megajournals are your best or only choice; they are just the easiest counter example.)  Moreover, a typical journal won\u2019t even ask for your academic rank and may not bother to investigate it and neither do the peer reviewers. The journal may even practice double-blind peer review, in which the reviewers won\u2019t even know your name and thus probably lack all means of finding out your academic rank.  Finally, while there are some people who judge a work by whether they know the authors (though they shouldn\u2019t), they usually do not look at authorship positions.

Where did this come from?  * * *  Anyway, your problems rather are these:    * Doing the statistics almost certainly qualifies your mentor for authorship, so he must agree on all publishing decisions. (The opposite also applies.) Even if you re-do the statistics, it will be difficult to argue that you did so completely independently. Also mind that any intellectual contribution qualifies for authorship, so think about any feedback or advice you got from your mentor on this work.    * Your mentor may have some power over you. I don\u2019t know them, but you must consider the possibility that they freak out over this and try to sabotage your career and particular this very paper.    * The biggest advantage of having an experienced mentor contributing to your paper is their experience in writing. It is very unlikely that anybody produces proper scientific writing on their first attempt without help from somebody experienced with it.  Unfortunately, you have to judge your mentor\u2019s mentality yourself. However, unless you are sure that they do not abuse their power, I strongly suggest that you find another professor or similar who can advise you and possibly act as an arbiter in this situation.  "

Furthermore the Professor is suggesting more co-authors to save costs on publication, this suggests to me that it is going to a very good (expensive) journal or it could be going to a pay-to-publish journal, so I have asked for clarification. If it is going to a good journal that has for example $3000 publication fees and more authors are added, there's lots to say about that, but papers in \"top\" journals do not come by very often for people from every country, and adding co-authors can help: working together with several scientists that are more senior to you, is also in my opinion the best thing about doing science, as they often provide far more insights and improve the paper.  * * *  I agree with a lot of what the other answers say.

I very much believe that they said those things, but also keep in mind to try to take everything with a slight grain of salt.

Many people spent 48 months like that, and did not end up with any publication, and it is indeed very painful. Specifically, I'm thinking about all the 2-year (sometimes 3-year) masters students I know who graduated with no publication. This is not \"rare\" either: it actually happens all the time.  However it would indeed be nice (and even perhaps preferred!) for this work to get published. For that you **do not _have_ to**, but **might _want_ to** consider the advantages of having your mentor as first author (it is already understood that the mentor will be a co-author because they did the \"statistics\" for the paper):    * Your mentor might get very angry at you if you try to oppose their authority or advice. When asked for a letter of reference at the student level, often we're asked whether the student is a \"team player\": if your mentor is not too disappointed at you to outright decline writing a reference letter for you, there is still the possibility that they do not give you the best letter you might think you deserve. This can damage your future. If you maintain a good relationship with your mentor, this paper might just be the first of dozens in your career, many of them probably being far more important and impactful than what your present paper in question, because it will be at an even more advanced stage in your academic career.    * Without experience, you are more than likely to struggle severely in getting your paper past the gate keepers. Also, with no record of publication history, the referees might not take your paper seriously at all, no matter how good it is (this is why I alluded to taking what the professors at the conference said, with a grain of salt, because not many people behave the same way at a conference as they would when they are \"anonymous referees\". There's a lot of things that have to go right, and not a lot of room for anything to go wrong, if a paper written solely by an undergraduate is to get published in a good journal. If the mentor writes the article, the paper usually has a much better chance of being published. People might agree that the mentor can claim first authorship if they write the article (although a lot of people, including me, would not ourselves be that type of mentor).    * Since you describe the \"blood, sweat and tears\" you poured into this project, you might like the paper to be published in a good journal, that will be widely seen. The mentor will most likely be able to help you with this, much more than you can help yourself at it.   > Do you think I should wait for a year or a bit more to publish it as a > graduate or should I let them take credits for my work.  No I don't think so, and here's why:    * The mentor does not want you publishing it alone (or as first author), and that's why they said that you \"can't\" do it. What they said about undergraduates, applies to graduate students too. Waiting a year won't help.   * The work might not be publishable anymore (or in the best potential journal) if you wait a year.  > The research is about horse welfare in my country and it has never been done > before.  You might be 100% right, but almost always when I hear \"never been done before\", it actually had been done before in some way, shape, or form. Many journals do not even allow words such as \"new\", or \"never been done before\", because it's impossible to prove it.  > This means a world to me. I want to devote my life to this area and > publishing my paper as mine would be only right thing to do, right?  I'm very delighted to hear your passion for research :)   I disagree that anything is the \"right\" thing to do, let alone \"the **_only_** right thing to do\".  The paper is still yours if you are a co-author. If you are a student, it will usually be known that you were the one that did the 4 months of field work and not the \"mentor\".  If you seriously do want to have any career in research, you will have to remove this way of thinking that being the first author is \"the only right thing to do\". You will have to make _compromises_. As long as you are not paying for _everything_ yourself, you will always have a \"boss\": you will never be 100% free to do things in whatever way you want best, independent of what other people want.  > Should I accept publishing the paper with someone else\u2019s name as a first > author?  Ask yourself this: **is it better than not publishing at all?**  If so, I will console you by saying that if you really want to devote your life to research, you are likely to be doing 60 more years of this, and possibly publishing 200 papers, and maybe 50-100 of them being first author.  This paper is not the end of the world, unless you cause that to be, by burning bridges with the people that might best be able to help you.  * * *  I would be happy to provide more advice if you have questions. I recommend you also tell us how many other co-authors might be involved (only you and your mentor, or even more co-authors?) and what the status of your mentor is (professor, assistant professor, post-doctoral researcher, graduate student, etc.).

The OP states that (1) she _\"did everything except the statistics, because by the rules, the mentor must to it\"_ and (2) _\"The idea, research, funds, time, peiple, animals, collecting dana, writing it down, writing abstract, introductionc, discussion, conclusion, literature, everything was mine work\"_ and (3) _an idea of gifting my own blood, sweat and tears is very painful/ not selling my blood, sweat and tears for \u00a3\u20ac$_.  (2) in essence indicates primary data collection on own costs and drafting. It does not include data analysis (in fact (1) states that statistical analysis was done by the \"mentor\") and finalising the draft for paper submission - with possible submission fees burdening the \"mentor\". Although the norm in the fields I am familiar with, especially at PhD level, is to give first authorship to the student, in terms of contribution and workload (technical analysis and writing up) the \"mentor\" may have contributed as much as the student and may qualify as first author. There is no information given on the depth and extent of the statistical analysis (in fact, I too find the statement that the \"mentor\" \"must do it\" based on \"the rules\" as very odd) and that may be just as substantial as the work done by the OP. On writing, just because there is a more or less completed draft, this does not mean that the writing technique, experience and style that would bring the paper past the editor and the referees are also present. The only information given is on what the OP has done, not the \"mentor\", so at the very least I cannot exclude the above. Very often, without such a contribution from a supervisor (which may seem minor, not so time consuming or easy from the point of view of a student) such work would remain unpublished and at the stage of an early draft. This may not apply here, but is worth considering.  Finally, I do not see how (3) applies. Although there are cases where (PhD) supervisors have usurped the work of their students by removing them from co- authorship altogether, the \"mentor\" does not make such a claim. I fail to see how not being first author consists \"selling\" own work, especially since the term includes a buyer and a transaction. Based on what the OP writes, the arguments of the mentor are debatable and/or incorrect but there may be some merit behind them. Even so, however, an experienced academic should not claim first authorship at the expense of a student, although that may be field/ situation specific (given the oddities above). That said, I am not sure whether the OP is in a position to assess realistically the importance and extent of the \"mentor's\" contribution to the paper, even as someone simply more experienced in the process. Pragmatically, I do not see second authorship as too negative an outcome in that case.  I would refrain from putting too much weight on encouraging and perhaps patronising conference comments. If the OP is so convinced of the quality of the work and her abilities, or thinks that anything other than first authorsip is demeaning, she can always submit the paper as single author. This entails the removal of **any** work done by the \"mentor\", otherwise submission is unethical. This also means that the OP cannot rely on assistance or reputational help from the mentor. Other academics who may be willing to help will certainly ask for authorship (maybe first), even for polishing and taking care of submission.  "

His contribution was the original idea- not a fleshed out idea that we just implemented, but a very general \"try this approach,\" a push in the right direction.

We have spent months doing research, and we have weekly-ish meetings, in which he asks us questions about what we're doing (we explain how our work, because it is our own creation) and he reminds us to write down everything we do. This has been his contribution for the duration of the project.    3. We are expected to write the entire paper ourselves- which he will then edit.  I have a meeting with him (one on one) in the near future and I would really like to bring this up, because first authorship would be huge for me or anyone on my team, whereas he already has an academic career. But I am only a first year, and he has expressed interest in doing future research with me.  **My question is** : do I have any leverage in this argument? Can I present this as a deal breaker for me for future projects? Is there any other way to denote who actually did the work that I can push for here? I'm not sure if he wants to make it seem like he did the work or if that's just \"what we do\" in my department for undergrad research.

Namely, if you are careful, you can bring up your concern with the advisor. However, if you do this, you shouldn't phrase it as an accusation or a claim that someone else should be first author; that would be unnecessarily antagonistic and probably would not help your case.  Instead, you could phrase it as a question. Say that you would like to understand how authorship order is determined better. Although you assume that the author order has already been agreed upon for this particular paper, as a starting researcher you are curious about the etiquette of authorship. You can ask if it is common for the PI to be first author in your area. Depending on how receptive he is, you can ask other questions.  If you follow this approach, then probably one of two things will happen:    * First, he could become defensive and dismissive. This is more likely if he is really being unethical. In this case, Buffy is probably right that your best bet is to let this go for now. Sadly, these things happen; author order isn't always determined correctly, and that can be either due to honest error or due to dishonesty. You could always talk to another professor or mentor for moral support and to assess how to proceed (particularly for future projects), but probably for this one accepting the order is not such a big deal in the grand scheme of things.    * Second, he could be helpful and receptive. Maybe he will explain that he is usually first author on his papers. Perhaps he has a good reason for this. For example, in some fields, that is accepted, while in others that is pretty condemned (I don't know what is the case for your field). But he could also have some personal justification for why to go against the convention. I would not agree with him, but perhaps if he explains this then it would make it easier for you to understand.  Whatever you decide, try to see the bigger picture that authorship is not always obvious, and this professor will be judged for his own actions by colleagues and the community in the future; it's to some extent out of your hands.

I'm fortunate to be in a field (econ) where the order of authorship is always alphabetical, so this doesn't come up. But even here, there's a fairly famous story of a firmly-established, well-known professor telling one of his grad students something like: _\"This is great work, and will for sure get published. It was sufficiently your own that you can publish it with yourself as the only author. If you do so, it will go to a good journal. Now, if you want to put my name on it also, then it will surely be published by the best journal in the field. The choice is entirely yours.\"_  The story goes that the student opted to put his advisers name on, and sure enough, was published in the top journal.  My point here is that, rightly or wrongly, you shouldn't think of authorship as strictly merit based. Right now, despite everything you wrote, it strikes me as utterly normal that the professor overseeing undergraduate researchers would be the first author. Instead of fretting over it, be very happy that you're getting authorship as an undergrad (maybe that's normal in your field; in my that's incredibly rare), and then think toward the future.  Regardless, congrats on having a professor who is this interested in doing research with someone who is still early in their undergraduate career! It certainly speaks well to your work so far.  "

Therefore the work you submit largely represents your own drive to pursue this sub- specialty and is the product of your own self-discipline and self-taught knowledge without the high level supervisory input afforded to some other students. This is one of the reasons why you are applying to department x, because the expertise aligns with your passion and you do not have access to it at home. You could even consider saying that you would be very interested to receive feedback on your work as well as being considered for the application.  2) You should also seek feedback anyway on your work beforehand if possible. It does not necessarily have to be a professor and does not have to be face to face locally. I don't know if this is the done thing in maths, but perhaps approach an academic (who you know has done similar work) with a specific question based on your work. You might get a positive response and who knows where it will lead.  3) You seem quite upset about whatever was going on. Relax and let it go, because these sorts of behaviours are encountered _all_ the time (and a lot worse actually). Don't take it personally, you just have to find a work- around. It is what it is, let it go and work around it.  "

        "answer_body": "  **_Note: this answer assumes that you might be considering pursuing research after your undergrad, by applying to PhD programs._**  You have to balance two things here:    1. The value of an academic publication.    2. Pursuing your own research interests and career goals.  Firstly, it is important not to underestimate (1). **Publications are academic gold.** It doesn't usually matter so much that the area of the publication is the same as your interests. If you apply to computer science programs you would be able to list that you have this publication; you might be surprised that even though it is not in computer science it is still likely to look extremely good. Roughly speaking, I would guess that it is at least 50% to 75% as good as a publication in your area of interest.  Why does a publication look so good? It tells admissions committees: _This candidate knows how to do research, and is successful at it. They have already worked with a professor in a research group. They are able to see a project through to completion, and they know how to write._ Notice that the area of the publication is irrelevant for all of these factors.  However, you cannot ignore (2) either. Research flourishes only when you are passionate about it. In the long run, you need to pursue research that matches your interests and particularly that is true when you are interested in computer science, not civil engineering.  With that in mind, I would suggest you make a compromise. It is highly in your interest to see this published with your name on it, but you also want to minimize the time that you spend on it. So you can reach out to your collaborators (professors) and say that you had underestimated the amount of work this would involve, and you don't have enough time or experience in this area to write the entire paper, when you are more interested in pursuing computer science research. However, you would be happy to work on it a certain amount. For example, it would be wise to set aside a week or two to work on it, particularly if there is no one else who an write it. But set a limit up front; if this is going to require a month or two of your time, then it is no longer worth it.  If you do end up writing the whole paper, you should make it clear that **you are not interested in any follow-up work.** You just want to follow this idea through to publication, and then you can move on to your own interests.

I just took the intro to PoliSci course, and I think I've done pretty well in it (practically guaranteed a 4.0).  Anyways, onto the question. So I emailed my professor (as it was an entirely online course), and sent this....  \"Professor ----,  [insert some stuff about grades, course]  Lastly, are you aware of any research/volunteer opportunities in the PoliSci department at ---? I am aware of the [insert name of local policy network], but was wondering if you knew about any other interesting things going on. I'm really interested in public policy (my additional major is in it!), but the international relations section in the course also interested me. I'm particularly interested in humanitarian/human rights work. I haven't taken many PoliSci courses yet, but I would be interested in getting involved in the PoliSci Department in any capacity.  Thanks,  Corjine\"  He responded a few days later with this:  \"Hi Corjine,  [stuff about courses/grade]  In terms of research work, most professors are happy to work with students as both research assistants (i.e., you help a faculty member on their work) or as research advisors (i.e., you work on your own research project and a faculty member provides oversight). I'd recommend looking at our bios online and directly contacting anyone that who's work look interesting or related to what you're wanting to research on your own. **If you need additional help, you can also ask me and I'll do my best to refer you to the most appropriate person (I can also send an email introduction to that faculty member to help grease the wheels).** \" [emphasis mine]  thanks,  Professor ---\"  I haven't taken many PoliSci courses yet. The meat of my courses for this upcoming year will be my arts/humanities and linguistics courses, as that is how my degree is designed. The majority of my junior and senior level classes being PoliSci and upper level courses. So for the next year or so, I'm not going to have much formal polisci experience. I'll only be taking public policy analysis and a methods of analysis class (read: statistics for PoliSci students).  What I'm worried about is how I'll go about getting research experience without much of an academic background in it. I've had a passion/enthusiasm for politics for a long time, and the intro class was a breeze for me (barring a few theoretical concepts). I'm just afraid about how it will pan out if I take shots in the dark without having the proper background, so to speak. I'd love to get a jumpstart on research/volunteering/engagement if possible, but would it be more valuable for me to wait until junior year? And would that reduce my chance of a good recommendation from the professor?  I really am at a loss here. I haven't had any formal research experience before, and I'm working my first, true job this summer. I'm winging it the best I can, but I want to make sure I'm not totally shooting myself in the foot at the starting gate. Any suggestions/advice would be helpful!  tl;dr Is enthusiasm/willing to learn a good substitute for formal academic experience, or should I just hang tight for a year and wait to do some research?  Also, if this isn't an appropriate question for SE (I'm still pretty new here), let me know and I'll post elsewhere. Thanks!  ",

      "question_body": "  When I was previously an undergraduate research assistant in a small lab group (seven members), there was a situation where the PI had pitched a research study idea to multiple students independently, with none of us knowing that the others had been told about the idea. The PI encouraged each one of us to go off on our own and pursue the idea, try to make some progress, and eventually come back to them with a better idea of how to approach the project (perhaps even some preliminary results).  I only found out a few weeks later that the PI had pitched the idea to multiple students when a discussion with the other students shifted towards current projects and ideas. As we talked, one student mentioned that the PI had told them about \"a new idea for a research study\" and that they \"had devoted quite a bit of time making progress on the study.\" That research study happened to be the same one that I was pitched by the PI, and one that I had _also_ spent considerable time working on recently.  The PI had told me that good work on this project could lead to a potential conference presentation and/or journal publication, and I was keen on making good progress. However, finding out that I wasn't the only person in the research group working independently on the idea made me feel like I was unfairly placed into a competition I wasn't even aware of. I could have invested plenty of time into the research project, only to discover that a colleague had already finish more than I had and, therefore, made my progress effectively worthless.  I'm curious what members of the academic community think about the ethics of this. Is it ethical to pit people in the same group against one another on a project, with the credit going to the one that finishes better and/or faster? Do the ethics of this change when the students aren't told that there are others working on this?  In this case, I happened to be an undergraduate research assistant while the other was a master\u2019s student, but I'm wondering if this matters. At the time, we were both paid members of the lab, but I've heard about similar situations where one/both people were volunteer undergraduates working for free.  One part of me says that I was entitled the fair opportunity to work on the project knowing that I _would_ receive due credit for any findings I made. But another part of me says that this is the nature of academia, and I should learn to thrive in situations like these.  ",

This is how most people get by, as there are simply not enough interesting and unique projects at undergraduate level that everybody can get their own. (And if there are, it would take too much time developing them.)    2. It is **borderline unethical** to set up a **competition between students in your lab** , dangling the prize of a conference presentation or a publication ahead of them. The focus should be on how to do good research, not how to get ahead of your colleagues - even though it is sometimes also part of research. I can see how this could be done in a somewhat fun and productive atmosphere, so I will not dismiss it off hand. But I would much rather have the students work together, than against each other.    3. It is **blatantly unethical** to have a **competition among your undergraduate students without informing them** , that they are in a competition, first. I assume from your post, that you have never said yes to be in such a competition, and that you in good faith assumed that your chances of getting the \"prize\" would be based on your performance alone, and not how it compares to the performance of other students. This is a kind of \"bait and switch\" strategy, also often used for job interviews, where you get a person in the door by promising them a reward - but at the end of the day there is only one reward, and many people competing.  Finally, you mention that part of the prize is also \"credit\". Here I want to tell you, that if any scientific work is done towards a specific publication as part of the non-winning studies, the authors of said work should be credited as co-authors.

It should be possible for every student to succeed and even to get full marks in any course.  But there is nothing wrong with getting _truly independent_ thought processes going on a research problem. You were given the opportunity to solve a, perhaps hard, problem using your own resources. There is a lot of value in that, both for yourself and for science.  Search around for information about the search for how DNA works (Double Helix). There were independent groups that attacked the problem from different angles. It was a rather extreme competition to be first.  But, I don't think the professor wanted you to sabotage one another in the search and they were correct that one or maybe several of you had the potential for publication. In fact, different approaches to the same problem can each be worthy of publication since the path to a solution is often (some fields, anyway) even _more important than the final answer_.  And if the professor is wise enough they will recognize that for a budding scientist the search itself is valuable even if unsuccessful.  If the professor was willing to reward everyone for their work, not just the first over the line, there there is nothing wrong with this, and much to be admired.

The PI identified several students who were potentially capable of conducting research on this topic.   3. The PI pitched this topic to all of the students in 2, above, dangling the prospect of publication as a prize. So far we're on neutral ground.  The ethical issues relate to the nature of the resulting \"competition.\"    1. The decision about publication will be made by a neutral third party such as a scientific journal, that will accept all \"qualified\" entries. This is the best possible result.    2. The decision about publication will be made by the neutral third party that will choose one project for publication, including candidates from the \"outside\" the group. This is OK.    3. The PI makes the choice of deciding which projects to submit for publication, selecting all that meet some objective \"qualifying\" standards.This is OK, also.    4. The PI makes the choice of selecting one student project to submit for publication. This is the case that raises ethical issues, at least as I see it. If there is only one \"prize\" and it is awarded by the PI (rather than a neutral third party), then the nature of the competition should have been disclosed to the students beforehand, IMHO.  "

I have applied to some Master's and PhD programs but while I was doing that I have talked with PIs of the research groups and they said that they want me to stay in that university to do my Master's and PhD there. At that time, I was getting rejected from some of the PhD programs and I feared that I will get into any program, so I told them that I will stay (I didn't lie, that was my actual intention at that time).  But, now I have been accepted to the PhD program that I wanted most and accepted the offer directly.  Since I have started working with them, they have been great advisors, very generous, kind and they definitely have changed my entire life, let alone my academic career. The research environment and the post-docs have been also quite good and we have even published an article which I am also a coauthor.  Given that I have (prematurely) told them I will stay there (at that time, the applications hadn't even started) and now will go elsewhere, I feel like I am cheating them and thing that this will \"burn the bridges\", which I definitely don't want.  **Question:**  Given the situation, how to approach my PIs and tell them I will not stay there for my graduate studies? They even asked me how I was doing in this epidemic multiple times, so I cannot simply write a cold, professional email.  Note that, the field I have been working in there and the one I will work during my PhD are quite close, so we (me and my advisors) could possibly collaborate in the future, and in fact I would love to be in contact with them and help in any way if I can (my expertise on the field is limited but I am learning new things every day).

This is not necessarily anything about you or your abilities; he may just be busy with other things, or not very interested in working with undergraduates in general, or too disorganized to keep track of potential research students. But any of those would suggest that this is not someone that would be a good research supervisor for you at this time.  If you did start a research project with this professor, you'd be counting on him for actual supervision: advice on what to learn and what to work on, feedback on your progress and on your products (papers, code, etc), availability to meet to help get you unstuck when you are stuck on a problem, signing necessary university paperwork, collaboration in writing and submitting papers if you get that far, and so on. You can see from many questions on this site how frustrating a research experience can be if this sort of support is not forthcoming, and it will be especially important in your case since it's apparently your first time getting involved in research. And the fact that he is already so unresponsive to something as simple as \"I'd like to talk about research opportunities\" is reason for serious concern that he'd be similarly unresponsive when you really need his participation.  I would suggest that, at least for now, you move on and look for research opportunities with other faculty members - ideally, someone with a record of working successfully with undergraduates, and who shows clear interest in working with you. I think these are more important than a perfect fit of research interests.  You have plenty of time to consider approaching this professor again in a year or two. In the meantime, you might try to talk to other students he's supervised (either undergraduate or graduate) and find out how the experience was. This may give you some ideas about how to get his attention more effectively, or it may convince you that you don't want to work with him at all.  "

But since you are a freshman, make sure you are actually well-prepared to shine in such class before enrolling. Sometimes it is better to be patient and prepare well.  Another thing is to not get fixated on a particular sub-field. Research interests evolve over time, especially at an early stage.

First and foremost, **professors are often facing more students wanting to work with them than they have room for.** This is especially true if they are    * More senior   * In a trendy field   * Well known in their field   * In a department where not a lot of other faculty are in their field   * Teach graduate classes  As a freshman they don't know, **you haven't passed any of the gate keepers they likely use** to help filter the load of interested research assistants. This is going to make it very difficult for you to get your foot in the door, so to speak.  Another reason that an economics professor is highly unlikely to be interested in performing research with undergrads is that **undergraduate economics education really isn't much like graduate/professional economics research.** As just one example, you can achieve an undergraduate economics degree with just calculus 1, and sometimes not even that. You often can't even get into an economics PhD program without differential equations and real analysis, but at the bare minimum multivariable calculus (usually calc 3).  Even if you're somehow a shockingly experienced freshman, go back to the point that this professor doesn't know you, and is therefore judging you by what he knows of freshman in general.  So specifically, my suggestion would be to do the following:    1. **Take a class with that professor**   2. Do well in that class. Go to office hours. Make sure they know who you are.   3. Take more classes relevant to their field, particularly anything to do with research methods.   4. Try again as a junior or senior, when you've got your eye on grad school.  I applaud your enthusiasm for research though. Good luck.  "

Admission committees also know that your local options, especially as an undergrad, are limited. I did linguistics and computer science research as an undergrad, and then applied (successfully) to neuroscience programs.  If you can do well with your current work, I think you'll be good shape for grad school. You probably do want to address this change in your personal statement by briefly mentioning how/why your motivations changed and the skills you will bring to your new program. I talked a little about I saw machine learning techniques crash and burn on language/vision tasks, and wanted to understand how people/animals did so well with such lousy \"hardware\". I also mentioned that my existing training would let me analyze and model large datasets, like the ones I hoped to collect.  Finally, don't forget that some of your skills are \"reusable\" in biomedical engineering. The development of tracers for PET/SPECT involves a lot of chemistry, ditto for flourophores for microscopy. Process experience can help when building or using high-throughput screening systems. There's also a lot of interest in developing substrates that nerves, blood vessels, etc can grow on or are compatible with certain techniques.  This is all conditioned on you remaining somewhat interested in chemical engineering and doing well in your research+coursework.

It's pretty hard to learn everything by myself with simultaneously handling the coursework, so I'm wondering whether it's a good/sensible idea (wrt say grad school application where I need to compete with many people from top colleges in USA who are taking legit number theory courses by world class number theorists) to switch completely to geometric analysis and ditch number theory ? I think I can focus more on geometric analysis in that way too -- the only thing that is bugging me from switching completely is that I like number theory more than geometric analysis.  There were one guy from my college who went to Princeton for number theory who wrote a solo number theory paper as an undergraduate, but I'm nowhere close to being that smart. Also I can do reading courses/summer internship under some active number theorist researchers in my country, but the problem is that you need to know some nontrivial amount of number theory before you can do some internship under some reknowned number theorist !

You can make a decent living as a statistician, and pursue number theory in your spare time. The fact that the distribution of prime numbers has properties akin to a probability distribution, in view of the prime number theorem, indicates that work as a statistician would not be inconsistent with doing number theory as well.

To even begin to understand research in most areas of number theory, you need two full years of graduate coursework over several subfields of mathematics.

You probably won't get into the 20th century in an undergraduate course, and not much beyond the 1940s in a first graduate course.  Except for a few exceptional students who are taking several graduate courses while still an undergraduate, no one is doing serious, mainstream number theory research as an undergraduate. Hence, it doesn't matter. You're not competing with people who have somehow learned lots of number theory already.  I should add that, in the job market for permanent positions in pure mathematics that support significant amounts of research, the sky has fallen. Only exceptional people are getting permanent research-oriented jobs now.

        "answer_body": "  > Is it reasonable to do [SUBJECT X] without active/good prof in uni  I will answer generally, since whether number theory or something else, the advice is the same.  It will be harder, for sure. Having a good advisor, active, in your research area can be extremely important, especially early on in your PhD, to make sure you are studying the right areas, and learning things that are relevant to current academic research. Without such an advisor, you will have to be a lot more proactive in learning things on your own, reading textbooks and papers from your research area, studying problems, and digesting material (e.g. blog posts) from some well-known researchers at other universities.  However, by no means is it impossible. And there are three points to make here:    1. Having **_no_** professor in the subject X would be even harder, but here you merely have no **_active_** professor. That leaves you in a much stronger position. I would advise against being officially advised by a professor who is not active, but you can still have a close mentorship with them, and they can be your \"real\" advisor if they are interested and available. Just because they are not publishing anymore doesn't mean you can't learn a lot from them.    2. Your passion and interest in a subject will take you far further than any mentorship. If you choose a subject that you are not interested in, then why do a PhD at all? To spend 5-10 years on something, you must truly love it, and truly want to become an expert. If you do want those things, you can succeed, although it is a lot of hard work. (Your interests may evolve later -- I find that almost all students' interests do, e.g. evolving more towards what their advisors do -- but if you are right now interested mainly in X, then you should do X.)    3. By the end of your PhD, whether you have an expert in your field or not, you become an expert in your specific sub-problem who knows much more than your advisor. So, although choosing an area where you don't have an active advisor makes you \"on your own\" earlier, you would be on your own eventually anyway -- that is the whole goal of a PhD.  "

We got all the forms settled and decided on a project. However, after a certain point (me reading papers to catch up on the work) he stopped responding completely.

I also tried to catch him at his office whenever I was free during the semester but completely failed. At the end of the semester I was awarded a B. Should I even address this on my application?

The issue is that people might wonder \"why did this professor not want to work with this student?\" and might wonder if there was some reason that you were a bad student. Of course, it would not be true, but it would unfortunately be hard to prove that you did everything you could to complete the research.  So I would do as Buffy says and not emphasize it, but have a prepared response / explanation.  Besides this, you seem to have email documentation that the professor started ignoring you, and there is a chance you could escalate this to the department chair. You should not propose that the grade be changed to an A, of course, as you did not do the work, but you could ask to have the grade removed. You could explain the situation and show the emails that were not responded to.  This would have been much more likely to work if you did it right after the grade was assigned or during the semester, so no guarantees, but it could be worth a shot.

And not just any experts but domain experts, or even sub-sub-sub-domain experts. So the current situation is probably about as good as it can be. Why?  Not everyone needs to be an expert in a field, but many people need some knowledge of it. So, in schools, students study the basics of things without any attempt to teach them everything. Students get a working knowledge of a lot of things which lets them be successful either in putting those ideas together to solve problems (application) or to go deeper and use further study to become experts (theory).  But you note that the step from novice to expert is a big one.  Think about closing the gap. Should we make school much much harder? Should we make scientists try to explain everything to novices whenever they write? Both of those would be steps backward, I think. The first would mean more failures, the second would slow down the march of science and make scientific papers repetitive so that the beauty of new results gets lost in the chaff.  There are papers (and books) at the intersection, however. Some people prefer to write survey papers in a given field, attempting to bring the general understanding of a sub field more accessible to a general audience. Carl Sagan was good at that sort of thing in astronomy, for example.  However, surveys of a field are only written fairly late, after the discoveries of a field have had time to settle in the minds of the experts, proving their worth. The most important discoveries can take quite a long time to become integrated into the general thinking of experts. Only then do the survey papers make much sense.  But if a novice wants to become an expert it can be a long and hard journey. University education, especially graduate education, is supposed to put a student on a path to expertise. Working on research with an expert advisor is the most common way. But the first few (hundred) scientific papers will be difficult. It becomes easier with practice. But so does riding a bicycle.  * * *  Note: Even graduate level textbooks are written for novices, but in a sub- field rather than the overall field. My first look as _measure theory_ was in grad school and, while I had a lot of mathematics experience, I was a novice in that particular subject.  "

Your current situation is more likely to result in a publication than a short term REU, I think. Also, if your relationship with the PI is a good one, it is less risky to stay where you are.  But if medicine is you real goal then research publications are probably less important and getting a broad outlook will probably serve you well.  The trade off is specialization vs generalization. Having a broad view of all that is possible in the world is a good thing, but academics at some point need to specialize in quite small areas. Your call, of course.  "

Please read and tell me if there's any other tag I can use for my question.  I would like to know what statistical tool I can use for my research. I am a student of Bachelor of Arts in English. I am proposing research topics, which require me to give my respondents grammar and vocabulary tests. Both tests have 25 items and the passing score is 50%. My professor requires me to have a scale for the test results. She said that it is \"Any statistical tool that you can use and fits your study.\"  The topics I'm proposing, which require tests, are the following:   1\\. A Comparative Analysis of Grammar Competence between \"a school I will not name\" 12th Grade Students Who Watch Lucifer and Who Don\u2019t Watch English Series to Discern Whether TV Viewing Should Be a Regular Learning Approach   2\\. A Comparative Analysis between \"a school I will not name\" 12th Grade Students Who Listen to Songs with Vocabulary Words and Who Only Memorize Meanings to Discern Whether Song Listening Should Be a Regular Learning Approach   3\\. A Comparative Analysis between \"a school I will not name\" 12th Grade Students Who Watch Video Clips with Vocabulary Words and Who Only Read Sample Sentences to Discern Whether Video Watching Should Be a Regular Learning Approach  I need to have at least 30 respondents who will answer my multiple-choice grammar and vocabulary test. I need to prove that there is a problem in either grammar or vocabulary in the 12th grade of the school. What scale should I use to measure the results? My professor gave the Likert scale as an example. I just know that this is used to measure the intensity of an answer. Can this be also used to measure test results?  I already have 30 respondents and 12 of them failed the vocabulary test. What statistical tool can be used to show that the problem in vocabulary is significant? The mean, median, and mode scores for the test are a passing score so I can't use any of the three as the tool. I tried using z-score but it only made the number of those who got 50% of the score lower.  ",

I was recently offered an unexpected but very promising commutative algebra research project, but because the research is time sensitive and needs to be completed by May, I would need to withdraw from my graduate complex analysis course to complete it. I am wondering if it would be worth taking the 'W' on my transcript in order to gain a (very likely) publication. I've been mulling the decision over for over a week now and am desperately seeking some advice. Here is some background:    * I am enrolled in 5 graduate courses (4 math, 1 CS) and a thesis writing class.   * I have participated in math research and presented it at conferences, but am not currently published.   * I have completed 4 graduate math classes in the past.  I tried cutting other commitments to avoid withdrawing from a class, but discovered that I just don't have enough time for my classes and research. Basically, I'm trying to gauge whether one more graduate math class or one more research project (albeit with a 'W' on my transcript) will make me appear more competitive to graduate admissions boards. Complex analysis is currently my largest time commitment \u2013 I am not confident that I can withdraw from anything else and still make enough time for research.  ",

I want to do high-quality research to build up my experience in preparation for graduate school (MS/Ph.D.). My research is out of pure interest, not volunteering or doing it for credit hours.  My goal is to go to a top 5 graduate school in my field. I have some experience in research since I worked on a research project last summer. I published a paper as a second author on that to a conference and it was accepted.  I found two research projects currently and they're equally as good but I'm having trouble deciding which one would help me the most due to my lack of experience.

The project hasn't been worked on much in recent years so I have full choice over the direction of the project.  Collaborate with one graduate researcher on this project.

The professor is in the College of Science which is a difference since I'm in engineering and he does not have specific knowledge about my field.  I'm assuming this means not many connections in my field.  The project is interesting, a novel application of the research in my field.

        "answer_body": "  I am by no means an expert in the realms of academia, prestige, or research papers and am an M.S. student myself, but my logical evaluation of this situation is that you probably have more to gain by doing project 1, for the following reasons:  1) Professor 1 is probably a better connection to have in the long run, especially if the school they went to is one of your top two picks. He/she will probably be able to be more helpful with explanations and sticking points during your research than Professor 2 as well, if only because they share a more similar background to you and can understand your mindset better.  2) Project 1 seems (from your description) as though it is more likely to get your name on a published paper, which is always a perk when you put months of work into something.  3) Project 1 has fewer people involved. More collaborators is not necessarily a bad thing, but it does allow for more time lost to communication (or miscommunication), introduces more potential for error, and almost certainly requires some overhead in the form of proper project management in order to efficiently utilize everyone. A two person project, while it can certainly benefit from the same processes, would not need nearly the same amount of organizational structure. Another thing to mention here is that having a majority of undergrad researchers on the project may mean that it goes slower than you might like, due to the fact that they are less experienced than you  **Keep in mind, though that bigger groups introduce more perspectives and usually better ideas. Additionally, the undergrads at your school could be brilliant and leave _you_ behind, rather than the other way around**  4) Project 1 is more directly aligned with your interests and should serve you well going forward. Especially since you have essentially been offered complete control of Project 1, you can shape it so that it directly feeds into the next project you want to take on after you complete this one.  5) Finally, I would like to recognize both of the original commenters for their contributions, because they are absolutely right (Sorry for omitting tags, fairly new to SE):   \\- a) If the project is not interesting to you, don't do it! I only wrote this as a guide with the assumption that you were equally interested in both, because you said both were \"equally as good\"   \\- b) Evaluate the professors based on their own merit and what _you_ know about them personally. If you don't know them well, try to find students that have had their classes and ask them. Try to get a feel for their personality and ask yourself if you're comfortable working with them for a long(-ish) span of time.  "

If the project is poorly-defined, has a lot of variables outside of your control, or is far too difficult to conquer in a summer, then you're in for a bad time.    2. **How helpful are the people you're working with day-to-day?** Most professors check in on you a few times a week (or less). Is there someone who will be able to work with you more than that? Is your professor accustomed to supervising summer researchers?     3. **Will the project be interesting to others, or teach you transferrable skills?** You should make sure your work (or at least your skills) will be interesting to future potential advisors.

Sometimes the error is a misunderstanding by a copy editor. In printed work, even by the printer's employees.  But the biggest issue is probably how hard it is for people to proof read their own material. I struggle with this constantly in my own writing. Once you put a mistake into a paper, you are likely to read over it when proof reading. You tend to \"see\" what you think should be there, not what actually _is_ there. One of the purposes of intelligent reviewers is to catch such things. But we are all human and the mistakes we make we often repeat.  If the \"error\" isn't thought of as serious to understanding by a reader, they may just ignore it. Or even, might \"see\" what they expect to see in such things as formulae.

Neither is true.

I had a very positive exchange with them and did a call, after which they were willing to offer me a research internship. Their university is in the US, the field is computer science, and I am an undergrad studying outside the US.  The internship went well as far as I could tell. At the end, they offered to write me a recommendation letter (without me bringing it up), and we agreed to keep working remotely after I returned home. We had a very interesting discussion going on, even after the official internship ended, which got to the point where they asked me about my intentions for graduate school. By that time I was also finishing up the results of the work I did, in preparation for publishing it at a conference, which we had talked about when I was still in the US. It was to be my first publication.  Back at my university, I was asked to write a report of the work I did, because it was counted as the mandatory internship experience required to complete my undergraduate degree. I knew beforehand that I was to write a report, but took it as administrative overhead which nobody takes very seriously, and did not mention it to my internship supervisor until after the internship was over.  I sent them an email before writing the report, saying that I couldn't write anything very convincing about the work I did without at least mentioning some of the ideas we had discussed. I asked them about the level of detail they would be comfortable with me including in the report, given that we intended to publish. I also mentioned that the report would be used by my department (which is Electrical Engineering) only for evaluation purposes, and that it would not be read by anyone working in a field remotely close to the one we had worked on during the internship.  After that email, I did not hear back from my internship supervisor at all. Many months have passed now. I even sent them the results of the internship work, and multiple reminder emails.  Was it wrong to fail to mention that I had to write an evaluation report earlier? Or was it just unacceptable to write a report at all about unpublished research? Might they have felt that my email was not written in good faith and that I was trying to share their ideas with my department, which in reality hadn't the slightest idea of the topic I was working on?

Don't assume that everyone hearing of your research, even in some detail, will immediately want to (or could) try to scoop you on a publication. People generally are more honest than that.  But it is, I think, fairly easy to discuss research without giving up too much in the way of detail on the conclusions or how they were reached. General statements about the field, the methodology, and your part in the larger enterprise are probably sufficient in any such report. End it with the statement that the results are being prepared for publication.  People in academia share quite a lot with colleagues. They even ask for and get advice without having to be paranoid about primacy or getting scooped. Getting scooped normally happens when two groups work on the same problems in parallel, often without knowledge of one another, but occasionally in competition.  "

There is no real need to take side trips into microbiology or anything else. Relatively few undergraduates in the US have any serious research experience when they apply to grad school. And in many graduate programs, serious research doesn't start immediately in any case. Some places have \"warm ups\" for the big event (dissertation research) but most have a lot of coursework leading up.  And of course, until you apply, you don't really know your chances.  Math is a pretty good background for statistics, of course. Much of the basis of stats is based on math. You may even have taken a probability and statistics course already.  It is odd, only because of the strange path to a goal. The winding path isn't needed here. However, microbiology might be interesting if you actually have an independent interest in it. But it isn't likely to get you much closer to acceptance in a statistics grad program.  Just. Do. It.  * * *  For the record, in Europe this might be different. But that is because both the undergrad and graduate programs are quite different than in the US.  * * *  And letters of recommendation is a separate issue, possibly serious.

It can easily happen that he is not motivated enough to work on the project alone and doesn't feel like he is worth much in the large group where, perhaps, there are several people who can do things better and faster, but wouldn't mind working with a single close friend on some small things here and there. It is just a wild guess, of course, but if you haven't tried this already, it probably won't make much harm. Just be sure to share with him some work that he certainly can do and that doesn't take too much time or effort in the beginning.  One thing that, most likely, won't work is to blame him for anything like \"piggy-back riding\".

Again I didn't practice enough for the final although I knew the material from self studying.  After avoiding math for a semester, I decided to take linear algebra, abstract algebra, real analysis, vector calculus, and combinatorics, over two semesters. I got A/A- in all of them. I hope that since these are advanced classes than calculus that they demonstrate that math acumen is not terribly low.

At the REU, one of the guys on my project team noted they had one or two sub-2.5 semesters. Everyone understands that the transition from high school to college can be a rough one sometimes so there's more leeway than you think here (this also applies when applying to grad schools from that I've read).  The more important thing than your GPA at this point is **getting strong letters of recommendations, as well as writing a great statement of purpose to really show that you are interested in the fields that your potential REUs will explore**. Being a 4.0 student in this regard will matter a lot less than actually **being passionate about the field you will explore in the potential REU program**. You mentioned that you are a junior, so hopefully since you've been in your major a while, you will have an idea of what those potential fields of interest are.  Also, do note that REUs are competitive no matter who you are, so just apply to as many as you physically can that are of interest to you. I applied to ~15-17, and was accepted to 3 (and one other summer research program abroad, I was in the process of applying to one or two more when I got an offer letter from one of my top choices that I ended up going to). **Especially if you're considering grad school and you want to REU's, I'd say give it your best shot and apply to all the REU's you can ... you'll have a 0% chance of getting in if you don't apply.**  Hope this helped and best of luck with your applications!

Note that more fame is more power and entails more responsibility. Reviewers may give some people the benefit of the doubt.

However, this was discusssing 2-year MS degrees with a thesis. Since I'm only planning on doing a 1-year non-thesis degree I'd like to know whether it would be worth it to pursue undergraduate research, or whether it won't make much of a difference to my chances of being accepted into a 1-year masters program.

I recently did an REU this past summer at a top-ranked CS school and am seriously considering graduate school, albeit after a break so I can be certain which particular area I may want to go into.  While I have my REU as some form of research experience, I'm wondering how much more I will need before I apply to graduate programs. In my department, there's been a couple who have worked in labs for maybe a year or so (but so far, nothing like two or three years like I have heard at other places), and others in our Honors program are required to do an honors project with a professor at the end. It's more or less rare that undergrads publish so much where I'm currently doing my undergrad.  While I have done the REU, I haven't gotten much further as far as doing research at my own school goes. I tried working with a professor one semester during my senior year, but I wasn't able to get much done before I had to stop due to a busy semester next semester.

But what will be impressive to a reader is that the applicant has done \"something\" that required hard work and has high quality. You can achieve this either in developing a thesis or in an REU.  My advice would be to pick one that interests you and you are likely to work hard at, but also one for which you get some local support. An REU might be slightly favored on the latter idea (support) provided that the research is guided in some way. But even a thesis could be given support if the student meets regularly with a faculty member during development to get some feedback.  Do something hard. Do it well.  "

        "answer_body": "  There are two issues here. One is what will enhance your future chances to get in to a program, I assume in the US. The other is burnout. I'll address them separately.  Burnout is a serious issue and you should take some effort to avoid it. But working in a research project isn't, I fear, different enough from what you have been doing lately to let your mind settle down and relax. I would suggest that a few months of travel (traditionally the South of France or Spain) would be a better solution. Get away from things. But 18 months is probably longer than required for this. Walk the Appalachian trail. Ride a bike from NY to FLA.  The other issue is about enhancing your application. In Europe, some research experience would be helpful because the European baccalaureate is much more specialized than one in the US, so more is expected of entering students. But in the US that isn't normally necessary. The doctoral program in the US begins with mostly coursework (or what I characterize as \"warmup\" research projects) and not the serious dissertation research seen elsewhere. Not every entering student will have any real research experience whatever, and little in the beginning curriculum requires it. There is a lot of coursework to enable you to pass comprehensive exams in the field. This is the \"breadth\" element of graduate study, followed, after a few years, by the \"depth\" element of dissertation research.  So, while a serious stint of research might offer a small benefit in admissions (in the US), I doubt that it is necessary.  But your topline question is whether it is possible to do this. I suppose it is, but it takes time and work to find a situation. A lot of places doing serious research will think you are unskilled, not yet having an advanced degree. You will be a \"trainee\" for a while. It probably won't be very satisfying.  Some people, however, find a way to stay on at their undergraduate institution and do some research with a professor or two, but otherwise only carrying a light load. This can be the best situation if you can arrange it. Another possibility is to have a current professor connect you with a colleague at another local institution to do something interesting. This might be a sufficient change of pace to avoid burnout and also keep you connected enough to academia to make for a strong application. Financing this might be a problem, unless someone has grant money.  "

Firstly, as Corvus correctly states, it seems _very_ unlikely that you can perform well in both roles _and_ do your undergrad studies in parallel (and I am not even talking about going outside and doing people stuff occasionally, which you should also not forget about).  Secondly, you should not forget that professors are human. Even though you are not doing anything \"wrong\" by any stretch of imagination, it is not difficult to imagine scenarios where either of the professors (or both!) don't take it well, and I am assuming you want letters from these guys down the road. The professor that you work for, for instance, may assume that you find his research very unfulfilling if you feel you need to invest your spare free time into a completely unrelated area instead of hanging out with friends etc. (S)he may assume you are really doing it only for the money / letter. The other professor may be disappointed at some point when an important deadline should be met that you can't commit more time to her/his project, because of your other duties.  Finally:  > Professor A doesn\u2019t know about this.  That's **never** great, and you should change this ASAP.

Maybe the paper requires mathematical tools he is not familiar, or has several words which are new to him.  Usually, I'd go with some assisted reading/reviewing. **This is very harsh, so be careful and prepared before attempting.**  Set up a meeting with plenty of time, explain that you'll be studying the paper and he should try to read and understand by himself first. Mark some time you know he should be calm (i.e. don't do it last hour of Friday or right after a difficult test, also make sure the student isn't hungry). Schedule at least two hours, but preferably have more allocated time on your schedule, and try to know that he'll be free after the scheduled time as well. Ask him to bring a laptop or have a computer in front of him at the meeting place.  Then, the strategy is to tell him to read the paper and interrupt him at least once per sentence asking for clarifications (what does this word mean? Can you rephrase this? Why is the author making this exception?). He should know that your are trying to measure gaps in his knowledge and habits, so tell him to be honest if he does not know anything and that it doesn't matter if that's the case (might be a particular poor strategy when dealing with people from a cultural background who have issues admitting they don't know something). The tense scenario will naturally keep him focused (though you should try to put him at ease).  When he doesn't know anything ( _I don't know this word!_ ) you can either explain to him (and check if he understood) or say something like \" _and how would you look it up?_ \" (that is why I've suggested leaving the computer close by). Very often, you'll notice he has poor googling skills, so you'll present him with some useful websites ( _Linguee_ comes to mind when dealing with translation issues, it is simple to use when you know it exists, but a student might not find it out by himself). Maybe you'll need to introduce him some book on the matter, and go through its index (some students may have only learned an important topic over classroom notes that he/she threw away, he might be unable to name a single book he could check some equation if needed be).  Additionally, this will reveal gaps in the student background, maybe there is a complete theory that is relevant to the paper but the student knows very little about (something like: _\"yes, you need to know trigonometry before learning calculus\"_ or _\"Yes, you need to study electrodynamics before studying quantum mechanics\"_ ). Many elective courses try way too hard to remove pre-requisites for students, and then student simply don't know about things that should be the pre-requisite in any sane place. The process of asking for clarifications over each sentence usually reveals this kind of gaps.  Often, people read complex texts ignoring parts they don't really understand. Maybe because they expect that part to be clearer as the reading progresses, perhaps they think they'll get it with more context, or they just hope that weird word lies in a sentence that isn't actually important. This is a poor reading habit that almost everyone has at some degree. However, struggling students might take it to a whole new level of reading without understanding. Part of the idea is to identify when this is happening and forcing the student not to ignore too much of the text.  **After a while doing so, you should:**    1. Have taught the student how to use some tools that you are used to, be he never heard about.   2. Have provided him with good basic references if he needs them.   3. Have identified topics you expected him/her to have mastered, but he/she actually knows little about.   4. Improved his/her reading habits a bit.  Explain to him that this is not to be done often, as it is too much time consuming and stressing for both of you. Also, the whole point is to fill basic gaps, once they're filled, this tool should no longer be used. Over time, he should get better at identifying these gaps by himself, and asking for assistance as needed.  Another note on how to handle the student:  > I have two other students who are working on similar topics and they get it.  Unless they have very similar backgrounds (i.e. same bachelor degree at same university) to the struggling student, the comparison is more likely to be unfair than otherwise. Even if just in your mind, avoid comparing colleagues directly, and specially never compare colleagues in front of them (or speaking to either).  "

Bear in mind that having a journal publication is not necessary for admission into any PhD programme that I am aware of (certainly not in UK physics). While a publication in either field that you mention would certainly boost your application, don't worry if nothing publishable comes out of your Master's. Just do good, solid work and ensure you have a strong grasp of the foundations of the field.  If you do write a paper, be sure to do it under the guidance of your Master's supervisor. They will help you organise the content and choose an appropriate journal. Submitting to arXiv is fine as long as you quickly follow it up with submission to (and hopefully acceptance in) a peer-reviewed journal.  Your supervisor (if they are active in the field) will also be able to advise you on which institutions to apply to for your PhD. When I was deciding where to apply, I mainly looked at the institutions of the authors whose papers I was frequently citing.

I have also taken part in research for 3 years at my undergrad. university that will result in a publication within the next 6 months (unfortunately, not in time for graduate school applications as this is my senior thesis).  **In my statements of purpose when discussing my research projects, is it okay to simply talk about my hypothesis/question, methods, results, and overall implications without listing out the formal titles of my projects or how I communicated these projects (e.g. a poster session or a presentation in my cases)?**  I have very limited space in my statements of purpose to discuss research, so adding an extra 1-2 sentences about my presentations (place, date, formal titles of project, etc.) takes a lot of extra room. I also am given the chance to upload a CV and typically list my posters/presentations in some sections of the application.  The reason why I ask this is because my PIs and advisors have told me to always list the \"proof\" of my work (e.g. poster or presentation in my case) at the end of my research explanations in the statements of purpose.  PS: Some applications tell me to highlight \"whether any of these research activities [research projects] resulted in a presentation or publication.\" In these cases, I most definitely will include formal project titles/dates/locations of posters and presentations I gave.

I think if you're just starting out and trying to learn the ropes, I think an important first step is to get a feel for what research looks like in your field so that you're better positioned to conduct your own research independently in the future. If I were guiding a student in my field, I'd want them to understand: 1) how are papers structured in our field, and what type of information is generally included in most papers? 2) how does new research critically examine and contribute to the existing research? 3) how are empirical studies designed in terms of their methodologies? What considerations to investigators make in selecting participants, instruments/tasks, their methods of analysis?  Publishing is a rough process, but a reasonable goal once you have a strong understanding of what the norms are in your field. RE: writing to reiterate/further support existing findings...I'm not too sure. I think it depends; I feel like if you're further proving ideas that are fairly new/not quite established, it might work. However, if there's already a huge body of literature supporting said idea, then I don't think most journals would be interested in publishing that.  "

First of all, it is not ok for your coauthor to add others to the paper without your consent (or that of everyone involved for that matter). This is especially true if the paper has already been accepted for publication. In fact, some conferences expressly forbid this practice as it can lead to very bad behavior on the authors\u2019 side as was noted in the comments. I would check the conference submission guidelines to make sure your coauthor isn\u2019t violating them.  Should you consult your fellow coauthors on this? I think so. The criteria for coauthorship can vary widely across disciplines and labs. My personal view is that proofreading doesn\u2019t warrant it, but that may depend on its extent. I honestly doubt that two people had so much to contribute that they had to be added as coauthors in the last minute, but I could be wrong (it is very weird though).  What can you do about it? Your options are are basically getting other coauthors to support your claim, and having a conversation about the new authors\u2019 addition. Your nuclear option is to contact the conference chairs and inform them. This alternative, however, has a very good chance of having the paper withdrawn from the conference altogether. If you\u2019re interested in joining graduate school then this is not a good idea (though it is arguably the ethical thing to do). Remember, you could also just flat out say that you\u2019re not willing to have the paper published with their names on it (if one coauthor objects the paper can\u2019t be published), but you\u2019ll be burning bridges if the professors on the papers don\u2019t have your back.  What should you do? If you want to get into graduate school then swallowing this ethical pill is your best bet. I\u2019m guessing this was something your coauthor banked on when they pulled this stunt. Try to chat with your professors and see what they think, maybe you can figure it out.  "

Anyone reading your CV will accurately decode that as 2nd author of _n_ >2 you presumably made a significant contribution to the work, but were not the P.I./lead writer nor the supervisor/funder. Whether _n_ =8 or 6 will make little difference; it is not that you get _1/n_ credit.

To the extent you are concerned about fairness or even skulduggery, that may be another story.

The scenario you are concerned with is highly unlikely. Professors would probably not steal your ideas from your applications, but rather actively fight to get you into the program so that they can start working with you (if indeed you have a very good idea).  If you truly have good, novel, ideas that you feel are worth publishing, and are worried about them being stolen, how about working them out into a two- page note which you can then put up online/on ArXiv, and then reference? This leaves no doubt as to the ownership of the idea, and gives professors a chance to assess your work _and_ your capacity to convey it in writing. However, if that is really the case, you should probably contact professors individually (via email) with your manuscript and have them evaluate it. That way your emails act as evidence that the idea is yours.  "

      "question_body": "  Lately, I've been wondering why institutions with a primary emphasis on undergraduate education (e.g. liberal arts colleges) value research output amongst their faculty. This is not intended to dismiss the research of LAC faculty, but rather to delineate what value the institution/department gains by hiring candidates with superior research output, perhaps at the expense of someone with a stronger teaching record. Here are several reasons I have heard, arranged in reverse order (approximately) of direct student benefit:    * Current faculty wish to promote research in the discipline for its own sake, without regard educational benefits for the students    * Tradition, or emulation of more prestigious institutions.    * Faculty need a strong enough research output to get tenure (a somewhat circular reason)    * Reputation within the research community enhances departmental and institutional prestige, with incumbent benefits for students.     * The faculty can extend their academic network to their students. Examples of this might include increased regard for letters of recommendation and awareness of (non-)academic opportunities.    * Research output is a proxy for breadth of knowledge within the discipline, hence for value of content in instruction, both formal (course syllabi) and informal (answering that random question during office hours).    * Research output corresponds to the baseline knowledge needed to supervise undergraduate research and teach best practices.    * Research activity is the best way to keep faculty aware of changing trends in the field, which in turn gets incorporated into educational practices. After all, academic careers last a long time.  I'm sure there are many valid reasons missing from this list, including some of the most important. I would like to know from a institutional/hiring perspective:  a) What reasons for valuing research activity are missing from this list?  b) What benefits are weighted most heavily? Which are given little or no thought?  c) To what extent are these benefits distinct from the ways that research profiles are evaluated by hiring committees?  ",

        "answer_body": "  I believe your list implicitly says this, but I'll include an answer anyhow, because I think this is an excellent question and I am interested in hearing answers that supplement what I write below.  Teaching divorced from serious engagement with the subject matter taught is arguably a very suspicious activity. In principle, if someone is paying a large sum of money to be taught a subject, the teacher should not only be able to convey his subject clearly, but also should be a practitioner of that subject. The living content of a subject is found in the minds of its practitioners, and so attempts to teach even the ideas which are archaic without the living insight driving honest contemporary investigation of the topic is very much in danger of becoming stilted, sterile or, perhaps worst of all, too packaged or neat.  One might oppose this view by pointing out that most undergraduate students do not need to know what is going on at the front lines of any subject, and the historical efforts and ideas, presented clearly in an engaged way, are enough. For cultural purposes, this may be so. However, a passion for teaching at the highest level morally ought to be accompanied by a passion for learning at that level, which is what research or serious scholarly engagement _is_ at its heart.  Another strong argument against requiring research is the following: students at an average primarily undergraduate institution are generally not going to be prepared for graduate study in certain fields, so why should time and energy of faculty be sunk into research in such fields. (Many good institutions with PhD programs also need to remediate entering PhD students, suggesting that this problem stretches beyond undergrad-only institutions.) Again, though, I answer that learning and teaching should, ideally, not be decoupled.  A third argument is that it is possible for an engaged teaching faculty member to learn for his own enrichment and that this does not need to happen at the level required for research or peer review. I can only answer this, unfortunately, by my personal experience and opinion. It bothers me that when a student enters university in order to learn a subject, he cannot tell the quality of knowledge he will receive (whether the community of peers of a student's professor regards the professor's ideas and approaches as relevant). It is our responsibility to ensure that students are exposed, to the best of our ability, to ideas that have impact. I cannot see how to do this without being able to point to peer-reviewed faculty contributions.  "

But, you don't need to just go idle when there is disruption. If you have a good working plan with team members then you can probably carry on when a meeting with the advisor gets cancelled at the last minute. Have a five minute \"conference\" on how you can make immediate progress. The do that. Or... Make a list of questions that need to be answered before you can continue. Things like that.  When you do get to talk to them, ask for advice they might have on how to continue effectively when meetings get cancelled.  You ask if this is normal. Some of it yes. Some of it is also exacerbated by the fact that it is a senior professor who has lots of time consuming and constraining demands. I hope you aren't their lowest priority, of course.

Canceling on you repeatedly at the last minute is disrespectful. \"Personal reasons\" can happen once in a while, sure. (Although at some point you have to wonder what's real and what's an excuse.) However, department meetings are never planned at the last minute. We are all extremely busy, and if you plan something last minute, the answer you will get from 50%+ of potential participants is \"I can't, I teach/have another meeting planned/am not even in the country that day\". Me and most of my colleagues try to adhere very strictly to already-planned meetings, and those who don't acquire very quickly a reputation of being unreliable. If a professor has scheduled a meeting with you and decides to go to a department meeting instead at the last minute, it's insulting.  There are at least two possible reasons for the professor's behavior.    1. The first is that he has abysmal organizational skills. This can happen. Talking about it can sometimes help, but you have to be careful about how you phrase this. It's possible that the professor does not even realize that canceling last minute is terrible for your own schedule; some people are just self-centered and have a lot of trouble putting themselves in another's shoes.    2. The second is that you are so low on the professor's priorities, and the professor values you so little, that he doesn't care about inflicting this kind of behavior on you. This is not the kind of person you want to work with. Being busy and senior is not an excuse for being an asshole. But you are now reaching the point where you have to choose your battles. Do you want to complain to the professor and risk retaliation? Do you want to switch advisors and also possibly face retaliation or bad will, or work on something that is less interesting to you? Etc. There is a huge power imbalance between an undergrad student and a professor, so unfortunately I have to advise you to tread carefully.  You can adopt palliative tactics such as the ones described in Buffy's answer. But overall, no, it's not acceptable for someone to do this to you, and in an ideal world you would not put up with it. But we don't live in an ideal world. Academia has a bigwig personality complex, and many (not the majority fortunately) believe that they live on a superior plane of existence, wayyy above commoners, students, and underlings.  "

        "answer_body": "  You should address your concerns to the appropriate representative body and ask them to raise them with the faculty.  **Important**  You need to establish clearly if this pattern of behavior is typical or atypical for people with similar responsibilities in the institute. Ask other groups for their experience. If at all possible try to get some stats together to support your case.  If there is no (student ?) representation body that can deal with this then, _as a group_ you need to formally contact the head of the department and assert the need for this issue to be addressed without delay.  It's for them to work out a strategy to do that.  The initial suggestion will (at a guess) be that you \"talk to the professor\". This of course is just a way to avoid responsibility. You have no authority to negotiate with this individual and they seem not to be able, for whatever reasons, to handle their workload. It's the department which needs to shoulder this responsibility.  If the department refuses to act then you may need (again ideally via a representation group) to address this matter to a higher authority within the institute.  No, it's not reasonable for this to _consistently_ happen. The purpose of that institute is to teach and research. Mentoring is not an optional extra, it's a core function. The issues here are simple :    * Meetings cancelled at last minute because other last minute things crop up  This (if true) is departmental chaos in operation and while you might expect the occasional meeting to be cancelled for these reasons, they're not running a crisis management center for the police, they're running (or not running well) an institution where student requirements _ought_ to be an integral part of the working day. There should be time allotted to this and that allocation should be respected. Exceptions happen, consistent issues should not.    * Meetings cancelled for personal reasons  Well this happens, but if it's happening a lot then, again, it's a departmental issue to properly cover the work. It's quite unfair to students (and others) to have someone whose personal life consistently interferes with core working responsibilities. Again it's a case of occasional being normal and a high frequency of these issues being a real problem that needs a real response from the department.    * But there's rarely any follow-up for makeup meetings; if there is, it never moves past us giving our research professor our alternative meeting availabilities.   This is another sign of either departmental chaos or individual chaos. There's a clear issue here that needs to be addressed. When you were taken on it was to mentor your development. If this is consistently not being done properly then it's a departmental level failure (at least).  **Very, very important.**  Lastly in fairness to the individual you need to note that they may be severely overloaded by an institution that is happy to exploit them (and as a result, your group). Do _not_ seek to assign blame in any contacts with the institute - this sets up a confrontational situation they will feel (right or wrong) they should defend to the hilt. This is why a representational body, which likely has people more experienced in resolving these issues, is so important.  You are _not_ going to war, you are seeking a solution or solutions. That will almost certainly involve compromise.  "

I am seeking opinions on my personal situation regarding the decision to include either a resume (1-2 sides) OR a CV (multiple pages) in my graduate school application for the schools that don't provide me much space to write about research. I also want to know about whether or not I can include research experience blurbs in the CV.  Originally, after being told by most schools that allow up to 5 recommendation letters to only submit 3 and after being told not to upload anything in the \"optional and additional uploads,\" I felt a resume would be better for my application. Less writing and easier to read for the admissions faculty. However, I know many Ph.D.students that have submitted CVs, and almost every school I'm applying to states that I can submit a CV.  I don't have that much to discuss, aside from 3 significant 2+ year teaching experiences as an undergraduate student and 3 research experiences (2 summer internships + home university research since I was a freshman). Unfortunately, I won't have a paper out for at least another year due to an ongoing study. I am also active in several clubs/honors societies. Thus, my current \"resume\" is 3.5 pages long. I could probably get it to 2 pages, **but this is where you come in.**  Would you suggest to expand even more, possibly elaborating more on my research experiences so that my CV is around 4-6 pages, or would you recommend to keep it as a brief resume? For the CV, can I include 4-5 sentence research descriptions after I list the knitty-gritty stuff (e.g. program, what I did in that research program in regard to career building, etc.)?  **The main reason I ask this is that I'm slowly starting to figure out some schools give me absolutely no room to discuss research experience.** For instance, Johns Hopkins allows me to write a single page personal statement while answering quite a few other large points; thus, elaborating on research is hard. Also, I just contacted Duke who had a similar case in their application, and the Ph.D. admissions advisor for neuroscience told me to include details about my research experiences in the CV or the optional supplemental uploader. Harvard told me not to utilize the optional supplemental uploader to further discuss my research, although they allow CV uploads.  Regardless, for some of these schools, I will need to at least include a few extra sentences about my research whether that be through the optional file uploader or a CV.

What will matter more is the GPA which will help out a fair bit. The previous research experience may hurt or help; at least in math some REUs try to admit undergrads without experience to spread them around, but that's not all of them by any means, and for the most part it would be helpful. I suspect the situation in biology is similar.  Since you are a junior, you should already have some connections within the biology department, either your adviser or faculty whose classes you have taken. They can likely give you more personal advice since they know you better.

        "answer_body": "  Unfortunately there is no meaningful way to estimate your chances of being accepted into any specific program or set of programs (REU or otherwise), because selection is not strictly random, nor is the criteria uniform or transparently available to applicants.  However, while REUs often mention the goal of increasing participation of minority candidates, in practice this varies from \"a strict rule where only minority candidates are chosen\" at some few programs to \"its just something we are supposed to say, and the vast majority of people who end up in the program are not classifiable as a minority but that's not something we make a point to mention on our website\" at others.  I understand the anxiety these sort of selection decisions cause, especially given the tremendous ambiguity and opacity of decision criteria, and especially the fear that vague bureaucratic-double-speak can cause.  My advice, having done an REU myself - and to even apply I had to push past a lot of fear of wasting my time and thinking I had no chance of being selected for any, but then being offered multiple options - is to apply if it is something you might like to do, and that's it. You cannot count on being chosen, or even hearing back on a decision from all places you apply (I had at least 3 big-name programs not even notify me of selection and they ignored my email follow-ups to their program coordinator).  If you have a good option that requires material commitment (like, say, a big deposit or signing some contract with explicit big penalties if you change your mind) before knowing what the other offers would be, I'd encourage you to decide what your taste for risk of it not working out is - i.e., with big risk comes the need for a good backup plan.  Personally, I had to roll the dice between summer employment and REUs that had very different decision timelines. I ultimately realized many of them had more flexibility than I realized, and while I would have preferred to not give late notice on turning down an internship and another REU offer I was otherwise excited to do, it worked out and people were far more understanding than I would have expected they'd be. You are a student, and these are opportunities meant to help you - so most places aren't going to be heart-broken if you have to change your mind, etc.  See what sort of flexibility you have on changing your mind if some options turn up you didn't expect, and then if there is an option I always suggest you roll those low-price application costs and see what happens.

Find out which meetings, activities that your head of lab goes to. This might give you opportunities for informal discussion about your project and for him to get to know you.

Emails also force you to articulate and write out your confusion which is a great way to learn and practice writing.

I'm just a bit nervous/paranoid he'll say no so if anyone has any advice/words of encouragement, I'd appreciate it.  I understand that letters should come from people who know you well and I plan on my other two to be from professors that I am close with at my school. Given that I attend a school where there are limited research opportunities, I consider it to be integral that I get a letter out of this experience that speaks to my capabilities as a researcher. Based on the advice from the career office at this visiting school and other lab members, the letter should be coming from the PI/professor. The scientists I work with will contribute to a strong recommendation - they themselves acknowledge that it just wouldn't be as valuable coming from them. I guess my nervousness has to do more with the fact that here with big labs and big name PI's everyone says this situation/procedure is the norm and coming from a smaller school I'm not as used to it.

I will try to demystify this process for you:  When a student asks the professor for a letter of recommendation (usually by email), he forwards the email to me with something like:  > Remind me about this student, what did he/she do?  Then I'll write back, reminding him who the student was, what the student's project was, and if the student was a strong student, and he will write back,  > OK, write the letter and I will sign it too.  This is a totally routine interaction and it would never occur to him to say \"no\" (unless I said I couldn't recommend the student, having worked with them.

There are several other ways how the duplicate submission would eventually be discovered. Let's say the paper has been submitted in parallel at two conferences called A and B.    1. There could be a shared reviewer for conferences A and B who notices the duplicate submission. In this case, the reviewer would probably contact the chairs of both conferences, leading to an immediate disqualification of the paper. Note that such a reviewer would not have to be a program committee member at both conferences: program committee members often delegate their workload to colleagues in order to reduce their workload.     2. If the paper is accepted at conference A, the paper is eventually published in A's proceedings. In this case, the reviewers from conference B might become aware of the submission of the paper to A.

I\u2019m fairly certain nothing magical happens to students once they start their graduate studies that makes them suddenly capable of working on complex problems. If you\u2019ve done well in your undergraduate studies and are curious/handle failure well, you can do graduate work. What would raise red flags for me is that other RAs worked on this problem and failed. I would ask the professor for more details and perhaps see if the problem can be broken down a bit so you can successfully manage it.  Showing good results in an RAship is much more than an interview boost. It\u2019s an excellent way of checking whether you like research work, getting a very warm reference letter and maybe even a decent publication or two! Good RAships can get you into top grad school even if your undergraduate degree wasn\u2019t amazing.  Good luck!  "

One professor I had in my first semester was in research so I feel like that would be a good start. Or should I go to my advisor first?

Perhaps they can get you started with some part of their own explorations, or give you a problem they have set aside for lack of time to explore it.  In your first time out, it may not be vitally important that you actually come up with results. Learning the process may be enough. But who knows. Maybe you learn something that can be published.  In fact, some problems worth exploring don't really have _accessible_ solutions. They may be beyond the current state of knowledge to solve. The same is true in math, of course. It is very difficult to predict in advance whether a problem is actually solvable with the resources available - including time.  Eventually - many years - you will probably develop the insight to see the problems that are unsolved, but solvable, and also worth the effort to explore. But like anything else, that takes practice.

I would like to do research with a professor at my school during the semester for (among many other things) graduate admissions. However, I have been able to secure a mentor or arrange for this research over the past ~year. I have contacted many professors by email (and sent polite follow up emails after a few weeks) but only a couple responded, and they said they were too busy to work with undergrads. After that strategy yielded no success, I tried to go to professors office hours and talk to them face-to-face; however, the majority said they were too busy, were already at capacity with undergrads, or did not have a lab/research area that was well-suited to undergraduate research.  The professors' reasons are of course completely valid, but I am very worried about finding a research opportunity and the attendant impact on grad school admissions. I have spoken with more than half of my school's faculty in my major (and many of the remaining faculty do not have significant lab groups and only work with one or two graduate students at a time). I believe that part of the problem is my school\u2014it is very highly ranked in this field in the US, and the undergraduate population is very competitive. I am a slightly above-average student in the department, but I can't compete with the very top group for research positions. Would it be advantageous to transfer to another university with a lower-ranked department in order to increase my chance of finding a research position?

It would be advantageous to do so keeping your short-term goals in mind. However, since higher institutional prominence also leads to higher fund allocation, I would not have done so in your position (if a PhD at the same institution was my goal). From my point of view, if you as an undergraduate at the university have so much trouble finding a research group, how much steeped does the climb get when you are competing for a PhD position?  Or should I just contact the professors again next year?  Yes, contact group leaders until you find a group willing to take you. But, don't be a bother. If a professor has been indifferent towards you, it's highly unlikely they are going to change their opinion with ten more emails. **Contact only those,** who have shown slightly positive response, indicating that their lab currently has no open positions for UGs but will have new ones later.  **What I would do**    1. Contact junior group leaders who are joining or have joined your institution in the current funding cycle.    2. Contact the group leaders you have ignored  > (and many of the remaining faculty do not have significant lab groups and > only work with one or two graduate students at a time)  The above will provide you with better mentorship and growth opportunities, as you do not have to compete with 10 other people for their time. Furthermore, they might also be more inclined to take you on as a PhD scholar later on. In my field, joining a prominent group leader's lab hardly leads to good mentorship from the professor directly. You will be mentored by a Post-Doc or a PhD and at the end of your term, you will count yourself lucky if the professor meets you even once or remembers your name.    3. If you are still desperate to work with the most prominent groups, then you should approach their senior PhD students and Post-Docs. Not the group leaders themselves.  This is my advice from experience. You must get a very good feel of the lab you are joining, before you join it. It is not the project, but interactions with your mentor that lead to you becoming a better scientist.  Finally, do not be swayed by the big articles that are listed on group websites. People tend to be envious of them, but they hardly notice the years of toil that goes into such article.  For some perspective, I have worked on average 10 hours a day, 7 days a week for the past 2.5 years to create an article which has now been submitted to a journal of some prestige. I have also met people who have worked for a decade on a single project but have not submitted the study.  "

First, you are at a top institution. Next, you are a top student - you are obviously dedicated. Next, you aren't alone and there are at least a few of you in the same circumstance.  Consider forming your own \"research group\". Become its leader. Find a faculty member who will give you a problem to work on and maybe give you occasional ideas on your progress. The commitment of the faculty member can be minimal and your research discussions are mostly among group members. Find someone, maybe even a postdoc, who can give you some ideas about research process in your field.  But if four of you approach a professor it is a different sort of thing than going alone. A junior professor might be an especially good \"target\".  Try to have your group meet a couple of times a week to share ideas and what insights anyone has.  Produce a group report at the end of some period of time, even if it only discusses directions, not successes. You can even discuss failures, since it was learning that was important and it is just as good to know what doesn't work as what does in many cases. Offer the report to some faculty member and ask for comment.  This will have two benefits. One is that it should enable you to learn something about research process even if it comes with small progress. Knowing how to go about research is an important skill in many fields and it is good to get some practice at it.

If you want to get someone\u2019s attention I suggest avoiding mass generic emails (they\u2019re obvious and I ignore them). Try to show interest in the work. Perhaps send your thoughts about a specific project you\u2019d like to be a part of. You\u2019re competing for someone\u2019s time: try to show why you\u2019re worth it.  "

        "answer_body": "  As mentioned in the answer by lordy, it is going to depend heavily on your field and journal. But to expand on things, here are a couple thoughts about including code directly in the content of the paper:    * Programming language: You're code is going to be in just one of the many available programming languages out there. That might limit its usefulness or make it more difficult for people that are not familiar with that language.   * Line lengths: Often it is hard to write readable code that fits into the line length of a single printed page. You have to resort to things like shorter, potentially less useful variable names, splitting lines, etc. Also, different journals might use different fonts that change how many characters fit on a line, so you might have to spend a lot of time just reformatting the code for different submissions. It's worse if it has to be in a single column of a two-column layout.   * Conciseness: there might be a lot of things that people don't need to see to understand the actual application of your paper, like initializing variables, unrolling loops, etc. This is just wasted space that may count toward word limits.   * Future-proofness: Ideally, you don't want any part of the main content of your paper to become obsolete in the future. Technology changes, standards change, etc. Eventually your code could become unrunnable. It's probably impossible to avoid altogether, but including it in the main body of the paper just makes it more prominent if it does happen.  With that, here are some alternatives, some of which have already been mentioned in other answers/comments:    * Pseudocode: basically the same as including code, but negates/offsets most or all of the negatives outlined above.   * Supplementary info (SI): Many journals allow the inclusion of supplementary material. You could potentially include your code here. This has the advantage that no matter what, there will always be an archival record of your code associated with your paper that you don't have to spend time managing.   * External repositories (e.g., Github): This makes you responsible for ensuring the code continues to be available for readers, and also depends on the service's continued existence, but has the upside that you can fix mistakes, add features, etc.  There's nothing stopping you from including all three options. Pseudocode provides permanency for describing an algorithm, supplementary info provides a combination of permanency and utility for an example implementation, and an external repository provides utility and future-proofness for actual mainstream use.

Are you sure, they are needed for the paper? Keep it at a minimum, if you're not explicitely writing about user interface guidelines. There are many ways to implement an UI for a specific application and when describing the method, it does not matter how you arranged the buttons.

The idea of an article is to communicate ideas, and listing code in an article is fine as far as it makes the article more readable and the code itself presents necessary clarification. To do so, the code should be clear and self- contained. That is all function names or variables do not need references to other code files that are not presented in the article.  This practice can be easily replaced by pseudo code instead or diagrams, and I would only put code in a paper if the paper describes how to use the code itself. For instance presenting how to use/call classes of a package I have developed. The reason is for avoiding putting code is that, which programming language I am going to use, the reader might not be familiar with it, and if things can not be communicated with pseudo-code or diagrams, then the code itself might not be clearer, since pseudo-code is developed in the first place to abstract the idea of code listing.  To summarize, use instead pesudo-code or diagram, and only list code to explain how to use a software package that the paper describes.  "

      "question_body": "  I am currently trying to apply to 7 different environmental REU programs and was wondering what my chances of getting into one would be.  I am a current senior pursuing a B.S. in Environmental Science with minors in French and Environmental Toxicology and will be continuing my 5th year next year (I switched majors in Sophomore year). I go to North Carolina State University, a R1 university, my GPA is 3.92, and I am a female, Asian-American first-generation college student who comes from a low-income middle class family (close to my state's qualifications for the \"poverty\" line). I have experience as a research assistant who assisted with research on aquatic stressors on aquatic macroinvertebrates, and I won a research grant from my university to conduct environmental engineering research last year.  I am seeking to participate in an REU because I would like to pursue a PhD and would like to learn as much as I can through research experiences in preparation for grad school. Right now, I would like to experience research outside of my home institution since I would like to explore graduate school options and other kinds of environmental/aquatic research, and the living expenses being covered would be incredibly helpful for me since I nor my family would have no way of paying for my living expenses.  Unfortunately (or fortunately?), being at a R1 university and having had other previous research experiences, I am unsure as to how likely it would be for me to get accepted into an REU program. I understand that most of these programs seek underrepresented minorities from liberal arts or community colleges with little research experience, therefore I am seeking a realistic analysis on whether or not I can get accepted into an REU program. I was told by others that I should exclude the fact that I got a research grant, but I am unsure as to how to feel about fabricating the truth to make it seem as if I have had little research experience. I am at a loss for what to do, but I have to complete my personal statements by next Friday, and I am rather stressed about my odds of acceptance.  Any advice would be greatly greatly appreciated. Just as a heads up: there are unfortunately not many other REUs with research/themes specific to the field I am going into (Non-marine Aquatic chemistry/ecology), so that is why I am only applying to 7 programs. Most other environmental REU programs are focused on forestry, climate change, or marine & coastal sciences as far as I can tell.  ",

There isn't a plan in mathematical research (or in most other fields) that will guarantee success. You are moving into the unknown, which is, well, unknown.  But there are a few hints that work (sometimes...partially). First, you need to deeply understand the essence of what you are about. This requires insight and insight isn't always gained even by earning a doctorate. Insight is what knocks you off the donkey when you aren't expecting it. Insight is understanding something one moment that eluded you the moment before. Insight sometimes comes from hard work, but it also sometimes comes from just riding on the donkey to get somewhere.  The hints:  Read a lot of papers.  Think about possible extensions of those papers.  Think about possible variations of those papers.  Think about applying the method of proof of those papers to some other, possibly unrelated sub-field.  Take a lot of notes and update them when you have any small insights. I find it useful to carry some of those notes around on index cards, just to refresh my memory (on the donkey).  Think hard about the essence. What is the derivative? What is the _essence_ of the derivative? Why is the definition like it is? Are all of those parts essential? Can they be changed? What would I learn if I change something there? Derivatives work nicely on _nice_ functions. What if the functions aren't _nice_.  Talk to a lot of people. Share ideas, don't hoard them. Work together. Ask \"what if\".  Take risks in your thinking. New sub-fields of math have often arisen from \"risky thinking\". Algebraic Geometry? What a [wild idea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_geometry#History).

Say, in Japan it was known as \"exam hell\", which is probably [over now](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/01/20/reference/exam-hell-now-not- so-hot/).  I believe this stage coincides with (a) growing demand for skilled workforce and (b) lack of educational institutions able to provide sufficient training. Putting it simply, there are more people willing to pursue higher education, but there are not enough universities ranked high among employers. Eventually the situation should come to a better balance, but it might take years if not decades.  The core issue for people like you, of course, is what to do about it right now.

      "question_body": "  A bit of backstory- I'm a rising sophomore undergraduate student studying computer science who is strongly interested in urban planning as well. This spring, I put about 12 hours a week of work into conducting undergraduate research with a lab at my uni and was offered a funded research assistant internship with the same lab this summer.  As this is my first time getting a real job (outside of high school), I had assumed that I would be working full-time this summer without communicating with my professor that much. Obviously, this was wrong to assume, but I have since learned from that mistake and take full responsibility.  However, my professor recently wrote me an email saying that he expects me to be working 20 hours a week, even though I have worked 40 hours a week for the first week of my job. I contacted HR and they said I was down as a full-time employee, but that if my professor expects me to work 20 hours, then I should only work 20 hours. This is the first time we have ever really communicated about work hours at all.  To make matters worse, I had planned to write a paper this summer, but the timeline I composed had assumed I'd be working 40 hours a week. The paper's deadline is on August 1st, and I'm concerned I won't be able to complete research working just 20 hours a week.  I am really interested in working on this paper, so much that I am even willing to put in time outside of my job to work on it, if necessary. My prof is unwilling to negotiate hours with me until mid/late July, and I plan on getting another part-time job now. I'm also taking 2 summer courses (online and CLEP though, so not too bad).  Should I propose to drastically narrow the scope of my paper so that I can finish it with a 20 hour work-week, or should I bite the bullet and try to keep working on the paper as it stands outside of work (time permitting)?

In the arts & humanities, it is actually quite common for students to go on to study or work in a completely different field. Does that mean that the degree/research was a waste of time? No, of course not.

      "question_body": "  I've currently finished two years of undergraduate study in physics. I'm at the end of a close to two month summer research program in math, at one of the best universities in my country. While I'd applied for a mathematical physics type project, the problem I was assigned has to do more with math and my job is to make a program in order to understand (the outcome of) this problem. My background in mathematics is not good, since the way it works where I study is that there is an extremely small math component in a physics degree and some extremely important concepts in math were excluded from this math component. While I have been studying independently, my course is generally lacking in rigour and depth in coursework so there always ends up being a lot of independent study that I need to do.  I wish to apply for a Master's program in Physics once I complete my undergrad (I'm doing a three year degree) and I'm considering applying to places in the UK and/or Europe. My background in math and my never having had formal education in CS certainly put me at a disadvantage during this internship. However, I am unable to decide if I should be asking this professor for a letter of recommendation in case my applications require one from a summer research guide or someone in such a position.    1. This is the only such research internship that I will be doing before applications begin (which happen in 2 months) so I do not have the option of asking anyone else for this specific position.     2. I'm also not sure how having only one summer research experience, and that too not in physics, plays out while I apply for a Master's in physics.     3. I'm also quite disillusioned at this point regarding just going forward with physics itself because it seems like I already have heaps and heaps of catching up to do and I'm feeling extremely overwhelmed and unsure of whether this is something that I'm good enough to do. I've always wanted to do physics and I enjoy learning and I understand that this is simply one summer, but I am quite anxious at this point.   I'm unsure of what to do, specifically regarding the recommendation. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.  ",

And what you are doing is pursuing an internship that addresses the gaps you perceive in your own background. You see a gap in formal CS preparation (even though that preparation is rare among _programmers_ , and even rarer among physics students), but you are addressing it by learning to program anyway. You see gaps in your mathematical background, but you are pursuing a mathematics internship that requires you to do a lot of independent study.

Is it better if I have other co-authors, such as another peer in my class?  Finally, if anyone has any suggestions for how I could possibly gain research experience, I would appreciate that as well.

        "answer_body": "  To answer your questions directly, yes, you can submit for publication as an undergraduate or as a completely uneducated person for that matter. Science and other scholarship is about the work, not the author's credentials. It will be credible if it is credible, independent of who you are. But it needs to say something new and interesting to have credibility. It is more, much more, than going through the motions of carrying out a study.  The only real reason for having a professor involved is that you can take advantage of his or her experience in doing research, writing it up, and getting it published. The name and credential is, as mentioned above, not the important thing. Likewise, a joint effort with peers is valuable since it is more likely that a few minds working on a problem will notice issues that need to be addressed and come to a better result. Other than that - little or no effect.  However, if you don't have any experience in doing this, it is pretty unlikely that you will be successful in your first attempt given the time constraints. Learning to do research and get it published, like any other learning task requires both practice and feedback. Many people, even with more educational background than yourself will struggle to reach the point at which it can be done with any facility. Most of them (a few exceptions) have the advantage of being able to bounce ideas off of much more experienced people - feedback.  Of course, if you do write something up and submit it to a journal or conference, it will be reviewed. If it has any validity at all you will get feedback from the reviewers. Hopefully it will be constructive, but sometimes it is disheartening. But it is better to get some local feedback before attempting publication, just so you get the practice and wind up submitting things that need less \"polishing\" to actually be published.  Like anything, though, you get experience through practice. Early attempts may be successful, but for most it takes a few tries. But the practice needs to be tempered by feedback.  If any of your professors have published material, you might want to approach one of them with some idea for a study. Ask if they can guide you and give you feedback. Even if you don't reach the publishing stage, that feedback will be valuable in figuring out how to approach research and how to make it presentable. Someone with more experience is also more likely than yourself to have an idea about what sorts of things are ripe for research. It does you little good to work on questions already answered and it normally takes a lot of study to understand where the research \"edge\" is any given field. A more experienced person can help with that, showing you what is the most important thing to look at.  "

I plan on applying somewhere else.  One option is looking for a research internship at another university or a national lab. On the other hand, I have been working in several projects at my home university and I am in a collaboration with another university. I have a publication done with a small group and a renowned professor in mathematics, and if I stay this summer I might be able to finish one or two more since I have been working in said projects for a year or more. The important thing is that I want to publish them before I send in my applications for PhD programs this fall. I think there is a considerably smaller chance of publishing if I go to an internship, and I might be able to apply to short programs like two week summer schools while I work here at my university. Furthermore, I already have participated in two summer internships at a Fermilab and Princeton, so I don't know if it makes any difference participating in a third internship, or if it would be better to potentially publish 1 or 2 publications more before I apply to a PhD program.

      "question_body": "  I have some undergraduate students doing research in my lab, and I pay them by the hours. I've observed that the students usually do what I tell them and don't go beyond that (as we usually expect from research) even though I encourage them to do so. They also work exactly the assigned hours (says 10 hours/week). You know, like the regular employees in a company, not like a researcher in academia.  I discussed this with other faculty members in my department, and some of them told me that I have been doing it wrong. That I should not pay the students (except during the summer) as this job is for them to have research experience and learn research skills. Only the students who are really interested in doing and learning research will volunteer to work in the lab for free, and these are the students we want in the lab, not the students who (mainly / only) work for the compensation. And my colleagues told me that they had very few undergraduate students working in their labs for free, but those have been very good students who would co-author papers and continue to graduate schools (Master or PhD).  On the other hand, I've heard from some good undergraduate students (in terms of GPA and technical skills) that they would never work an unpaid position.  I've been thinking about this lately. Am I doing it wrong? I'm not cheap, but if paying the students to do research results in wrong motivation and expectation for them, and if not paying them is a good filtering mechanism to select good students, maybe I should do that.  What do you think? Do you have any good strategy to have good undergraduate students doing research in your lab?  Btw, I'm in the US.  **Updates** : I was not clear in my original post, so here are some clarifications.    * My expectation: the research tasks for my students require them to get familiar with a programming language and learn to use some special software before they can do the research. These skills are not taught in the formal course of study, so I can't find any undergraduate students who posses these skills. These are very valuable skills in my field, especially in industry. If I were them, I would spend my personal time to learn these skills as fast as I can, and, in parallel, spend most of my paid time in the lab to use these skills to do the actual research tasks. I would do that because I am excited about doing good research work. That's my expectation. My current students have spent almost all their paid time in the lab to learn, rather than to do. And they only learn during the exact assigned work hours. Two months in, and they are still mostly in the learning / training mode.   * One might say that companies pay new employees to learn / train / retrain before they can actually do useful work. But a professor / university lab is not a company. Compared to a company, even a small startup, I have very limited funding and resources (not to mention the retaining rate of undergraduate students after training is much lower than at a company). I must figure out the best way to spend my fund.   * Purely from the productivity point of view, paying undergraduate students to do my research seems to be the worst way to spend my research funds and my time. A skilled PhD student or part-time contractor can finish the tasks much much faster and likely at higher quality than my group of undergraduate students can finish in 3+ months. I know that because during my postdoc, I mentored a number of good PhD students. The total cost would be similar in the end. Given that, why did I hire them and agree to mentor them? Because I liked that they seemed to be interested in research, and I wanted to give them opportunities to gain such skills and experience.   * However, if their cost is eating too much into my limited funding with a minimal return, I should have a second thought about it because in the end, no one but I must take care of my own business (my research, and eventually my tenure). Getting research funding has become increasingly difficult.   * Do I care about disadvantaged students and want to give them opportunities? My colleagues and I are going to organize STEM camps for many underrepresented students in the area, free of charge (of course with external funding). But I think this should be separate from my research career, for now.  ",

Whether you should pay them or not is maybe opinion based. Here are a few points:    * Many schools have too many students and too few research spots; taking only those willing to work for free seems like a decent way to thin the pack   * But, many students require a paying job; by not paying the students, you may inadvertently advantage wealthier students.    * A successful arrangement I've seen is that the professor pays for \"useful work\" (usually manual labor, or maybe work from a senior student who has learned something) and only offer unpaid positions for other work. But, in the US, \"unpaid\" is often not an option -- students either have to get credit or pay -- and since students have to pay for credits, this means they are actually paying for the privilege of working.

At many institutions, a large portion of the student body has to work while they study in order to survive. If student research is unpaid, those students will not be able to participate. Students who have to work are often also members of other underrepresented groups such as racial minorities.  It is also a justice issue. If students are doing valuable work, it is only fair to pay them. It is also unjust to expect students to work more than the assigned hours.  I should add that it is not appropriate to pay students for work that earns course credit.  If your research students are not achieving what you want them to do, you need to be sure you are setting clear expectations. You also need to be willing to part with under-achieving students.  "

You know, > like the regular employees in a company, not like a researcher in academia.  Well, yeah. Before I was hired, we set an expectation that I would work 10 hours a week in my mentor's lab. (In fact there may be a limit on students' working hours, my university's was 19.) I don't understand why you think anyone would work hours for free when they are paid hourly. If you need more than 10 hours/week out of them, then **hire them for more hours.**  Even if you had volunteers; you should set some sort of expectation with them for how many hours (on average) they should put in. Yes, some weeks will be more, some weeks less, but a volunteer should know how much work you want out of them.  > Only the students who are really interested in doing and learning research > will volunteer to work in the lab for free  This is not true; let me be a counterpoint. Only the students _who can afford to_ will volunteer to work in your lab for free. That is, students who have support from their parents, or who don't already work a job for money will work for you for free. I am sure that the best undergraduate research assistants do not come solely from the pool of people with wealthier parents.  > Am I doing it wrong? I'm not cheap, but if paying the students to do > research results in wrong motivation and expectation for them, and if not > paying them is a good filtering mechanism to select good students, maybe I > should do that.  No, not paying them is **not** \"a good filtering mechanism to select good students.\" You sound like a new professor, and I think your own \"filtering mechanisms\" will improve as you interview and hire more undergrads over the years. At my lab, we went through about three for a position over three quarters before settling on a good, motivated undergraduate.  * * *  **Edit:**  After thinking about this for a few days, I would also point out that some types of relationships don't need to be paid. For example, students at my university can do honors projects in their department. Supervising these students is more of a service from professors than an employer/employee relationship, and undergrads seek out professors to supervise them, rather than professors recruiting students.  I assumed from your description of your students having been hired for 10 hours/week that this isn't the relationship you have with them. To put it another way, if you are getting value out of them that either you or a graduate student would have had to perform (e.g. feeding rats, interviewing human subjects) you should pay them. **If you put out an ad looking for undergraduates, you should pay them.**  In terms of equity, you should always be trying to pay your undergraduates, but I don't want to deny the existence of some relationships where not paying them may not be unethical.

Join the group for a month without pay or credit, and demonstrate that you can contribute and collaborate. Solve a simple technical problem or two.    2. Get paid relatively low wages for a quarter/semester/summer to be a simple assistant to others in the group: an apprentice. Just do what needs to be done that day. Become an expert? Higher pay.     3. Get research credit for a project that's actually _yours_. You're expected to produce publishable results, if not a full paper. Increased future career earnings are worth the cost of tuition.     4. Get a summer or other research fellowship that combines the best of 2 (pay) and 3 (interesting project).

This is part of their studies, and they should not be paid (by you) - If they find someone to pay them for studying [military, scholarship], that's fine - but IMHO there should be no other money involved in the purely study-related relationship between you as examiner and them, just like you don't pay them for listening to your lecture.    * Students _working_ for you should be paid for the number of hours they actually work. IMHO this is also important to ensure a clean professional relationship when you meet them again not as employee but as students in a lecture/prescribed practicum/exam.    * To me, such a clean relationship is a matter of personal integrity and honesty. Both are IMHO important in research.   I don't want to work with people who cheat, and I don't cheat neither.  * * *  Let me answer also from a German perspective (chemistry).    * What I've seen so far are rather different the tasks for student employees vs. students doing the research practicum they are required to do for their studies.      * The research practica prescribed by my studies were rather like tiny theses. You got/chose a project, went for literature, developed something (e.g. I implemented a new experimental setup for the 1st year practicum), discussed this with your supervisor and in the end handed in a report. Expectation was that the supervisor spends more time in supervising/teaching them than they'd need to produce the work output of the student.   These students would typically work roughly the prescribed number of hours - partly because these practica also happen during the semester so they are restricted in time by the lectures they attend (though they'd also try to make sure they hand in a good and finished project)      * In contrast to that, students employed for helping were there to actually help their supervisors, i.e. a clear net gain in work done. E.g. not a literature survey for their own research but running an errand to the library. Not developing a new experiment, but just making sure all solutions are ready for the next batch of 1st-year-students. No measuring for their own project, but maybe working as \"autosampler\" for the supervisor. All in all, rather comparable to a technician job. (Which doesn't mean that the student cannot learn anything, but the amount of learning is more like the expected gain in experience with any kind of job rather than at a university course.)   Time are kept on a schedule or time sheet, I've never seen a discussion about asking more than the agreed hours without compensation in that context.    * The German university system (i.e. the corresponding law) is very sensitive on possible pressure/abuse of power in the surroundings of exams. Our professors are public officials. Mixing money and exams is a big no-no (although the other direction is of course worse).      * A professor asking a student to work without compensation for anything but the official courses the student is enrolled for and who is or will be involved in examining the student would get close to \"acceptance of benefits by a public official\" i.e. corruption (in relation to importance and vicinity of the exam).   In other words, the practice you describe from your colleagues would be considered illegal over here.      * If a student is employed, certain IP (exploitation) rights go automatically to the employer here - whereas a student explicitly holds all IP rights to the work done during their studies, including the thesis. Students are typically not aware of this. Both you and the student may be thinking you paying the student for a compulsory course is just nice. But particularly with a good student in a STEM lab (high chance of producing something relevant in terms of IP rights) this may be considered taking an unfair advantage of the student. And again, we're getting close to questionable behavior of a public official - now even without intent.    * Some courses prescribe or allow that the students do some of their practica outside university. These practica _can_ be paid (but often/typically? are not employment). Even a thesis can be done in industry this way. However, the official construction is that the marks are given by the professor (who is not part of the contract between student and company), and, particularly for external theses, the professor has a duty to make sure the conditions are not unfair against the student.   In my studies, external prescribed practica were in research institutes rather than in companies and we were not paid (just like our fellow students who did the same practicum at university). Voluntary longer practica (e.g. during semester break) were not called practicum but student summer jobs (Werkstudent), typically had regular employment contracts and like the student helpers you were expected to actually work, i.e. produce a net output.    * > if paying the students to do research results in wrong motivation and expectation for them   I'd say on the contrary: as a professional, I expect to be paid for my work, and this is what the students should expect and learn to expect as well. More precisely, I expect to be paid for signing/handing over my work. If the work stays my own, and _I_ am the one to decide what to do, that's a different proposition. I'm also happy to negotiate the exact terms. I've happily been doing research where we found a good balance with comparably low wages - and I quit a research position where I decided the balance was not OK.    * and you mention that unpaid work/over-hours are usually expected in research.   In addition to the non-monetary considerations above, over here the concept is that there are certain levels of salary that already include all necessary over-hours. This is clearly true for professors, and equally clearly not the case for student helper hourly wages.  * * *  All this refers to students up to Master thesis. PhD \"students\" are not considered students in Germany, and there things work completely differently.   `<rant>` In particular, the rules to avoid abuse of power are somehow systematically suspended. `</rant>`  "

They have existed for at least a hundred years -- e.g., G.I. Taylor did a foundational experiment in quantum physics in 1909, while he was an undergrad at Cambridge. But until ca. 2000, they were seen as exceptional things that only the most exceptional undergrads would do. As late as ca. 1980, there were no formal REU programs. At the school where I got my undergrad degree in physics (UC Berkeley), I think there were roughly 100 physics majors graduating per year, and of those my impression was that maybe 1 or 2 were involved in research. (No, I wasn't one of them.)  Over the last 20-30 years, credential creep has led to a situation in which many mediocre STEM students are expected to do an REU, simply because if you want to go to grad school, it's perceived as a box that you have to check on your application. I'm at a community college, so we don't do research, but our students often do summer REUs. I often talk to these students in September, and when I ask them what they worked on, I pretty uniformly find that they can't describe the science. At all. Not even at a basic level, like \"we were trying to find cancer genes in rats,\" or \"we were analyzing gravitational waves.\"  If you look at it in this way, it absolutely makes sense that your REU students don't act like researchers. They aren't researchers. They don't have the exceptionally precocious level of knowledge and ability that would allow an undergrad to do research. They are doing this thing because they see it as yet another hoop to jump through, and they don't really understand what they're doing or why.  "

For context, I am currently an OOS third-year undergraduate at UW-Madison. I work part time, about 15 hours/week and attend class full-time.

Most of the labs on my campus will not pay undergraduates even if they have a work study, and if they do pay, it\u2019s well below the average for other on-campus jobs.  To not pay undergraduates AT ALL is unfair and excludes all students that simply do not have the time to commit to 30+ hours/week for classes, 15+ hours/week for work, AND 10+ hours/week for research. We have to eat, and so often times, we have to choose between a decent paying job and research.

The professors work in two related fields (physics) and are friends.  I worked with Professor X on some of my research a few months ago and it went well. Professor X is allowing me to help him with his lab research over the summer and I am honored to do so. Of course, it would not be an every day thing and we will be working out a schedule.  Consequently, I spoke with Professor Y about a summer spot before starting my research with Professor X. Nothing was formalized here and I haven't spoken to Professor Y since beginning my research. However, I am very interested in helping Professor Y in her lab this summer.  **My Question:** Would it be seen as poor taste to ask Professor Y about helping in her lab this summer? In my email I would explain that I would also be working with her colleague.  I don't want to jeapordize my position or my relationship with either one of them, so, would it be considered \"double-dipping\" to help with both of them? If it is, would this have any adverse effects?  One option would be to ask Professor X if he would be alright with this. I am not sure about this option because again I don't want to put our relationship on weird terms.  This is undergraduate level, in the UK.  ",

While this may seem harsh, the fact is that hiring undergraduates is usually less efficient than doing the work oneself, so it rarely makes sense to hire a student that is intentionally reducing their productivity even further by working in two labs. That said, you are an undergraduate, so you should be able to ask Prof. X about what's appropriate without consequences.   * But this may not be really \"research.\" You mention a \"schedule\" and that it won't be every day -- maybe this is more like an hourly labor position (\"lab tech\")? In this case, I see no reason why you couldn't tell Prof. X that you're looking for another position on your off-days...this would limit your freedom to accept additional work in Prof. X's group, should the opportunity arise...but maybe that's worth it to explore Prof. Y's group.   Edit: Leaving this up, despite the downvotes...while it would be nice if every undergraduate could work in dozens of groups before committing to a sub-field, the fact is that undergraduate research assistants take a lot of the supervisor's time and produce relatively little, so it just makes no sense for the supervisor to hire undergraduate research assistants that are intentionally dividing their limited time among multiple groups.

        "answer_body": "  You are actually asking the question that most new grad students ask: how do I find, understand, and make an impact on a relevant problem in my chosen field of study? Most grad students are new to \"the\" field in some way. For instance, you say you have a background in stats etc, so you aren't totally new to the field, you are just new to the specific sub-problem. This gives you a big advantage over someone coming in from a totally unrelated field, like zoology :-P  tawalaya's answer is great and is the basics of how to conduct a solid literature review. The basic underlying idea is you focus on learning as much as possible so that you are no longer new to the field. I'd like to add on to it with a few caveats:    1. In your literature review, pay special attention to whether or not your solution counts as a contribution to the field or an application of it. This will in large part depend on which field you choose to make an impact in. Is the field deep learning? Image recognition? CNNs? What is a contribution in one field might be just a basic application in another. For instance, if you are trying to make an impact in deep learning but your contribution is just \"I put these two nets together and look at how good they solve a specific problem\", it's unlikely you'll make an impact. However, if your chosen field is image recognition and you prove theoretically that your network has properties that solve a known problem, it might be a big impact.    2. Watch out for people who have thought of this before. The unfortunate problem of academic research is that if you thought of it probably someone else has, too. Look far and wide to see if your specific solution, or something so similar to it to make no difference, has already been published or studied and cast aside. It's possible that the idea you think will work is actually no better than another, simpler idea. It's also possible that someone did a similar piece of work to your own and their paper just wasn't impactful enough to draw attention. This might happen because it's not interesting enough or because they published in a low-tier journal.    3. Be careful about merging techniques. In much of academic research, simply putting two things together and seeing what happens is not sufficient. You should look for how to prove that these two specific things, when put together, are demonstrably better. In your example, why, specifically, should GANs and CNNs be merged to solve this problem? Why not two other things? Why not additional things? How will you know that your network is better?   Ultimately, you're going to have to do more than just learn the field. You'll need to learn to distinguish and sell the value of your research to experienced researchers in the field.  "

There is, in my opinion, no reason to wait before trying out your research ideas. You will probably never stop waiting if you take that too far. But working blind is likely to lead to dead ends and you need to recognize (or get advice) when you are going down a blind alley.  So, it might be a better path to take a blended approach. Start out by spending some of your time (say 10 - 20%) working on your problem and the rest learning the field and reflecting back on the problem based on what you learn. Over time increase the research portion as you gain experience and spend less on reading the literature.  I doubt that such \"research attempts\" will be wasted even if they are unsuccessful. You will learn a lot about what doesn't work, at least.  I think that too many students wait too long to start working on meaningful problems. Of course, it is helpful to have an advisor to guide you initially on what is meaningful and what approaches might be tried (or have already be exhausted). If you have ideas, you should spend a bit of time on them, but be critical in your self analysis of what you have, not jumping to conclusions.  But you probably also would benefit from advice. If you don't have a formal advisor then you may still be able to bounce ideas off of a faculty member or other researcher in the field. Practice with feedback is a great way to learn.  "

        "answer_body": "  First off, I have a PhD in a top 20 - not top 3. I believe my school was 16 or 17 when I was doing my PhD. So I'm below what you are aiming for. So feel free not to read this post.  First of all, I'm puzzled by your comment:  > fairly vague (\"good letters of recommendation\", \"advanced coursework\", etc). > What exactly do these terms mean, and what should I - as a first year > student - already start doing to at least stand a chance sometime  Good letters of recommendation: You will need to get about 3 profs to write _good_ letters of recommendation when you apply to grad school. That means you need them to say you are _smart_ as in PhD-smart.  Advanced coursework: Take ALL the higher level courses if possible. Take some _graduate_ level courses if possible.  Now about grad school: don't think about the top 1 or 2 or even 3 for now. If your goal is math, then your goal is math, not the school. Just focus on math for now.  I do not know you, so whatever I said below might be useless and meaningless.  What can you do as a first year student? Get a good GPA, as close to 4.0 as you can. You want to take as many math courses as you can right? So do some self-study and test out of your gen ed courses. I had a student who tested out about 8 so that he can have time to take ALL the higher level courses.  Are you taking any math courses now? Then focus on them and do well. Doing well does not mean just getting an A. It means being near the top of the class. Your prof knows. Not all profs will take note. But some do.  You have to figure out which profs are interested in growing PhD students. Profs who care will be open to chat with you and guide you. The only way you can catch their attention and learn from them is to be at the top of your class. Ask questions in class (if possible, when appropriate). Do you study ahead? Talk to them during office hours and ask questions so that they know you are interested and are studying your textbook ahead of the class.  When I was an undergraduate I always study ahead. While studying all the courses, I will pick one book and study ahead until I'm done with the book for that course. Then I'll pick another one and study ahead. Etc. Don't just read the book. Do the problems.  It's also a good idea to think about your favorite area in math and study it on your own. Unfortunately if you are not very deep into math, you might not know where to go with this. That's why knowing a prof well will help. He can guide you.  If you have time and if you have not done so, I suggest you look at the textbooks for math olympiads. Study them and do all the problems. Try to finish as much as you can so that you have some time to try some putnam competition books. Math problems in the math olympiad and the putnam are very different from the type of problems you will solve in your regular math classes. In many ways they are closer to research-type math problems. Again, I do not know you. Maybe you have already done lots of math olympiad training.  Another very important thing to note is that it is your responsibility to keep your level of interest in your area (i.e. math) as high as possible. That means spending some time reading up on the biographies of famous mathematicians. Don't do _too_ much of that since you do have to study math.  Books are the most important resource for you right now. Ask your profs for good recommendations. Do not be surprised that your class textbook might not be the best textbook on that subject. It's just one that's convenient and easy to use. I have no idea where you are in your math education. But if you are in Calculus, then you can for instance study \"Calculus\" by Michael Spivak. If you are very strong in math and have already studied that, you can go on to other books.  Check your math library and see if you can find magazines you can understand. Try the American Mathematical Monthly and the Mathematical Intelligencer.  See if there's a math club you can join. Make sure it's a _math_ club and not just a social gathering for math majors. Nothing wrong with socializing, but if the club does not have math related activities, then it won't help your goal.  If you work very hard in the first 2 years, you might know what area you want to go into. (But it might change.) And if you take some grad level course(s) in that area in your third year, you might be able to attend the research seminar in that area, which might be a weekly meeting. You might be able to start doing some research during your senior year.  "

I recently came up with a new idea for a model to be published that the grad student thinks is a good idea, but he told me he has left working with the professor and no longer is working on this research.

I thought about reaching out the professor, but I am not sure what to say, since the grad student left, the project is essentially dead I think so it is more of just me having a new idea and not sure how the professor could help with it.

Even if it isn't disbelieved (and it probably won't be) it will be given less weight.  Let the professor know that you will, in the future (soon or later) be needing letters to continue your education. Some time to reflect will probably mean a better letter.  If some publication comes from your work, you may not qualify as a co-author, but try to get an acknowledgement in the paper if possible. Ask for it explicitly, I think. Even better to be a co-author, of course. But, make sure, in any case, that you have a record of the publication and that the prof is willing to say, in a LOR, that you contributed to the project.  "

I think that he has probably e-mailed every math/science/engineering professor in world. I wasn't even advertising nor was I in the market for grad students. So these just got deleted. I would get similar bombardments from grad students in engineering (I was in the Math Dept.) mostly foreign students, wanting the same thing. They were also ignored.  If a student can't get support in his own country/department, then that's \"strike one\" for sure. Sending spam to a country/department that shows that you don't know \"how things work\" in that country/department, is \"strike two.\" Our department admits and hires our TA's and RA's. The faculty have little to do with who gets to occupy those 3-or-4 person offices. So when I open such an e-mail, my first thought is \"Dude, you're asking the wrong guy.\" It's especially telling if the grad student is in the engineering building across the street and, having been here for at least a year, doesn't have any friends or mentors who can tell him good ways to find support. Specifically, it seems that the grad advisor in Electrical Engineering would know who the student should e-mail in the Math Dept. Yet he e-mailed me.

It may well be that whatever research work is described in that paper doesn't fit the basic criteria of novel, unpublished research results, and so it won't be publishable no matter how well you write about it. You can write an good paper about experiments reproducing some well-known result - that wouldn't be publishable. You can write a survey paper of some topic that'd get a great grade, but that wouldn't be publishable unless it's in some meaningful way superior than the currently best published survey.  It may well be that some undergraduate research project _does_ contain publishable results, I've seen multiple such projects, but most of them don't, and would not be publishable (no matter how well written) without substantial further research/experiments/etc. I have no idea whether your results on \"the screening and hit prioritisation of anti-cancer drugs for repurposing use against malaria\" constitute publishable research results, but _your mentor_ is the person who _should_ know best whether your research constitutes something that's considered publishable according to the standards accepted in your field, and if they have said that it's not, then I'd trust them.

You should also be ready to provide recommendations from your lecturers or Professors.  Also, a very good way in getting internship places is to ask your study advisor for help, or contact professors that you had lectures at. It is much easier to get a place when someone with more experience is guiding you. Moreover, you shall ask at your faculty if it is possible to get a student job, it very often includes some research, practical work for the chair.  In any way, you shall be ready to send some e-mails around with your CV and a good motivational letter. I got a post-bachelor internship in Berlin after 20-30 e-mails sent, which is considered pretty quick for a foreigner who does not speak German :).

However, at least in my experience, most research produces side projects all the time, and a group may just have one that fits your requirements and abilities. If a group advertises specific projects and does not find a bachelor student, they may also be happy if you are willing to take on such a project (if you bring all the prerequisites).  A very crucial factor in this is whether they expect that your work is worth the resources they invest into you (probably mainly supervision time). For example, my personal, field-dependent rule of thumb is that the average bachelor project takes as much time to supervise as to do the respective work myself. Compared to this, you have the advantage that you do not need to supervision for writing and defending a thesis, however, you also have the disadvantage that there is less incentive to make you finish your project. Another factor playing into this is the kind of work you would do: Experimental projects tend to require more supervision that theoretical or computational ones, shifting the balance against you.  Thus, the most crucial aspect is that you can convince them that you are capable and willing to complete a small project with a certain degree of independence. Enthusiasm about what the group in question is actually researching certainly helps in that respect.  "

Few people are selected (best work/presentation in the respective field) are selected and awarded (they get some extra money, quite a nice amount for the local costs). The results are not published in a journal but I think they are kept somewhere in a database of the university. This system is good because nobody expects the students to produce any significant results - compared to journals but they still get to do some scientific work.

Furthermore, my experience of undergraduate was not conducive _at all_ to publishing. I graduated from a mediocre UK university, and there was no original research done at all. Undergraduate is for getting you up to speed on the foundations of a field, preparing you for postgraduate where you study one sub-field, then a PhD where you push the boundaries of a sub-sub-field.  The questions linked above give advice like, \"Discuss it with your supervisor\". But as far as I'm aware undergraduates don't have supervisors.

The results of this can certainly be publishable. Other possibilities could be, a summer research project, or a direct-to-Masters program like the MPhys. In all these cases, the undergraduate will indeed have a supervisor.  Of course undergraduates, being relatively inexperienced, are not likely to get revolutionary results, but they can still achieve publishable results, and that can lead to publications.

It is easier to publish in fields which don't require a lot of experimental equipment(unless one is a member of some very big collaboration- some of the big papers out of the LHC have undergrads on the author lists for example), and so math is one of the fields where it is most common. In various areas of math, some areas are easier for non-experts to understand than other. For example, graph theory and number theory have more low-hanging fruit that doesn't require technical background, while for example algebraic topology has more trouble.  At a pure level of anecdote, my first published paper was actually in high school; this is rare but not at all unheard of, and I wasn't particularly brilliant.

Reasons why few undergraduates publish include:    * They aren't interested in research, or are more interested in all the myriad other awesome things you can spend your time on as a newly (semi)independent adult in college.   * They are interested in research, but don't manage to find a good mentor (typically a professor) to work with. Nearly all undergraduate institutions have professors doing research, but some institutions or departments within an institution have a lot more going on than others.   * They get connected to a research project, but their work isn't publishable. Undergraduates are typically unreliable (see first point), and so often are given high-risk or boring work (a friend of mine got a \"research\" job one summer crushing rocks into fine powder with a mortar and pestle).   * They do publishable research, but it doesn't come out until they are no longer an undergraduate. Even the fastest project rarely takes less than six months from start to publication, and many take multiple years. If a student starts researching in their junior or senior year, even a great project may not result in publications during undergraduate.  That said, none of these are particularly insurmountable obstacles, and with the right combination of interest, a good environment, and a bit of luck, it's quite reasonable to have work published as an undergraduate.  Some undergraduates even become quite well-published, simply by virtue of having the right combination of skill, luck, and circumstances. For example, this week a colleague of mine mentioned to me that one of his undergraduate students now had approximately a dozen journal publications. Until they said it, I hadn't realized this student's numbers had accumulated quite so much, but it didn't surprise me, since this student is a good contributor to a complex many-person project that publishes frequently.  In short: undergraduate publication is statistically infrequent, but entirely normal.  "

To acquire this information, both students spent a large amount of time that could have been spent towards writing their theses.

There may be a need for encouragement and understanding that that thesis may be even more stressing than other theses are, though.**  * * *  That being said, what kind of raises a **standard red flag is the approaching thesis deadline**.

Usefulness is not a useful criterion to judge the value of the scientific work here. Results can of course be valid or invalid, but it's not the results that can suggest they are themselves valid (by being positive or nice) - validity has to be established _independently_ of the outcome. The important question for validity and the exam is: does the student do sound science or not?

The problem is that if your fellow student abandons his project at this point, how is he supposed to complete a bachelor's thesis at all? At this point in the year, I guess he's used up significantly more than half of the time he has to actually do the research for this thesis. Starting a new one now would not just waste the valid work he's done so far, it would also leave him in a terrible position to complete a _different_ thesis. That result would surely be worse than this one.  So step back and consider what the real objectives are here. Ultimately, the bachelor's thesis is not expected to change the world. There are two primary objectives: (1) to give the student an opportunity to try his hand at open- ended research where the answer is not already known; and (2) to give the advisor a chance to see how the student does _given the project he's working on_. This project is all that is needed to achieve those objectives. Trying to change horses midstream would only confuse things, and would not be helpful to those objectives.  By all means, discuss his research with your friend, try to understand it for what it is, and try to come up with ideas to make the research even more useful. But don't suggest that it's not useful. You wouldn't be \"correcting\" him by saying that; you would be misleading him. And certainly don't try to find ways to spin it so that it sounds good; the research will be valid and useful if and only if he is honest about everything he has found. Understanding why this algorithm isn't as good as some other one could lead to deeper understanding and more insight to tweak one of the algorithms so that it's even better \u2014 if not by him, then possibly by others who read his results. Or at the very least, his research could let others who are wondering about this approach avoid wasting their time. That's entirely valid and useful.  "

As I understand it    1. A student will apply as a research student if they wish to conduct research at the university under the supervision of a faculty member, but are not interested in taking classes or obtaining a degree. You could want to do this for example as a \"gap year\" between undergrad and Master's (or Master's and Ph.D.), this could be a way to get some research experience under your belt, and perhaps improve your application for Masters or Ph.D.    2. Anything goes, as long as it is agreed between the student and supervisor.    3. You are not required to present anything.

As far as this program is only offered in a few number of universities or research centers; I just want to add some comment to the questions you asked.   In some universities, non-degree programs are offered as some students want to attend to the university not going through the official class-attending programs. I mean, in a non-degree program, the student may not have to attend all the courses offered in a degree leading program. The student has the opportunity to choose the courses he likes and the ones mostly near the field of research he likes to do. It may be noted that in a degree program, the student may have to pass a few number of courses which may be chosen by the group or department; but in a non-degree program, he has the opportunity to choose from a wide range of different courses which he likes more. I insist that that because these programs may not lead to a degree, each university may have its own regulations and the student may or may not have the opportunity to choose as many different courses as he wants. It is better to check the universities' websites.   The answer the your question about _why students apply for such programs_ varies. Some students prefer to enjoy the freedom of the program, choosing a number of courses and pass them,while they do some research activity in the research institute. Some researchers prefer to apply for this programs as they have passed some courses before and they are coming with a good research background; so they apply for a non-degree program just to expand their researches and do some publications at the end of the research period. Some other students are the ones who work in industry and do not have enough time to attend a complete degree leading program and have a research topic in mind; so they apply for such program and do research in the field of their desire.   _When we are talking about research_ , It means that we are looking for something new. When something is done before and the researchers looks for it; it is called research but the output may be a Review Paper not a Research Paper.   A non-degree program may differ as a matter of time. The research period may be three months, six month, one year or more. But as the research non-degree program student does research under supervision of a professor at the university; the output should be something like a publish paper, conference paper or a research report or book. If the person applies for a non-degree program and does not have any publication at the end of the research period, why does he attend the university?   The research student may _take most of the research period_ , by talking to the other researchers and students at the university. Go to some courses and read as much as papers and reports as he can. Develop new ideas for his future projects and gain ideas to make his work better.  "

I would also urge you to develop yourself as a geoscientist overall. Learn some more basic geology (the terminology is a zoo) or geochemistry (I find this stuff rock easy and interesting but many geoscientists are scared of chemistry). If you are interested in oil exploration, it can be useful to know a but about petroleum engineering as well. It's not what you do as a geophysicist, but really petroleum business is rather interdisciplinary and it the completion can be changed based on the geology.

You do have to be critical about this. I don't know your situation. But if you are currently suffering from an addiction, you might be prone to some of the same psychological defense mechanisms. And this might give you a bias in your work. But it might also be the complete opposite. So... just be critical and honest with yourself. If it negatively affects your work, you should not be doing this kind of research.  Also think about the worst case scenario: What if _someone else_ finds out? Would that be a career destroying situation? If that is a chance, then it is always better to admit it yourself before someone else can. It will help you stay in control of the narrative, and people will not hear about it from rumours.  Your second point was that your personal experiences have actually helped you in some way. That might be true because you do not shrug something off as a minor issue if you personally know that it can be a big problem, etc. **However, your personal experience is NOT science.** You write in a comment that you \"feel like [you are] pulling \u201cfacts\u201d out of the air lol (because no citation), where actually the \u201cfact\u201d came from experience and interaction with people similar to me\". Don't do that! Your scientific work cannot rely on anecdotes. You either have to cite a reference or you have to apply the scientific method, make people fill out questionnaires, write a study and evaluate its significance, and so on.  If it feels like you are pulling facts out of thin air, then you are not doing good scientific work, no matter how true those facts are. You have to have some kind of _measure_ of the truth of your facts. Personal experience is not a valid one. So if you think about using your personal experience to help you in your research, do so by using it to find areas that still need to be considered, but then consider those areas with the scientific method.  Finally, I want to emphasize that it is not a good idea to self-medicate or to power through an addiction, just in case that is something you're doing. Whatever your situation might be, I hope you deal with it by getting some professional help.  "

        "answer_body": "  > wet lab like actual experiments are getting more experience  It is a common misconception that biology almost always happens in a wet lab. Indeed, some things can only be done in a wet lab, but computational biology is actually one of the greatest examples that counters this misconception, due to its flexibility.  If you want to spend more time behind a pipette instead of a keyboard, you should be able to ask your research advisor for projects or classes that get you more involved in that direction, for example PCR and gene sequencing. However, if you believe that computational biology is \"less experience\" than wet lab biology, it is important to understand the benefits that dry computational biology brings to general biological sciences.  Take Mendel's cross-pollinating peas exercise. If done in the real world, it would take several weeks to generate a single generation of peas (and hope that nothing bad happens that causes them to die). With the power of computational biology and some programming, you can perform dozens or even hundreds of generations' worth of experiments in a single day.  The power of computational biology comes from the fact that it can be done either cooperatively or independently of a wet lab. If you only want to do data analysis, you can do that. If you want to apply some real-world wet lab culturing with image-based analysis of PCR scans, you can do that.  As a computational biology student, you should be able to determine as much or as little wet biology or computer science that you want to do. My thesis was entirely done without ever seeing a biological organism, as I only used neural networks to simulate generational development.  "

Since beginning the research I have enjoyed every aspect of it. I have gotten to read literature, submit an abstract to a conference and even work on an open source software project. I _love_ what we have been doing so far, and can not imagine not doing research in my future. Therefore, I am considering applying for a Phd in the next application cycle.  However, it worries me that I am in a **honeymoon phase** of research, using the definition from [here](https://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/a+honeymoon+period):  > The short amount of time at the beginning of a new relationship, activity, > or pursuit when everything goes well and seems to be free of problems.  I am a very passionate person and, as a computer scientist, know all too well the love of starting a new project only to become deflated and uninterested after the preliminary work.  There are numerous posts on this site similar to \"Is a Phd/research right for me?\" ([[1]](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/97918/how-to-know-if- i-would-like-cs-research), [[2]](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/13798/how-do-you-know-if-a- phd-is-for-you)) and \"How to deal with burnout/loss of interest in research?\" ([[3]](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/2219/how-should-i-deal- with-discouragement-as-a-graduate-student), [[4]](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/95747/how-do-i-know-that-i- have-truly-lost-interest-in-research-and-should-drop-out- of?noredirect=1&lq=1)). The existence of the latter questions seems to suggest that a honeymoon phase exists in research.  So my questions are:  _Is this sort of phase common in research? Should I be worried about it?_  _How can I assure myself that this is not a fleeting pursuit? That I will still enjoy research in 5 years?_  I understand the latter question might be difficult to answer, but are there any objective tasks I can carry to further explore if research is right for me (i.e. more breadth in research-based tasks)?

It reached a point that his advisers and him did not manage to agree in how to end up the research; so he just drop it, published some papers as an independent researcher and not he has a business company related to construction.  Bottom line, just enjoy the research tasks in which you are now immerse, and try not to worry too much about what will happen in the future. Who knows? Maybe we have a new Turing award winner in sight!  Cheers  "

For example, can you imagine enjoying this even if you aren't \"in love\" with this. Getting a PhD, even in something you love, will be hard. There will be petty, stupid things that still require time (formatting one's thesis...).

In my case, I discovered that no, I really enjoyed _this thing_ and was not actually just enamored with the idea of research.  "

There are three points against me and three in my favor. They are the following    1. Prof. M. works at another university, which is about 100 miles away from the one I'm going to. If he does accept to advise me, my plan is to travel to his university every week or every other week.   2. I am worse than terrible when it comes to social aspects: I talk too fast, lack common sense, and I feel horribly nervous when talking to other people (specially people I don't know), often leading to awkward behavior for not knowing how to act.   3. Prof. M. is a (local) bigshot. (I'm assuming he might be more selective because of this)   4. I have self-studied math and physics more or less to have approximately the technical understanding a second year graduate student would have. Of course, while I know about e.g. locally ringed spaces or bosonic string theory (or insert buzzword here), I lack most of the skills and experience a real graduate student would have, such as being able to critically read research papers or having research experience. Also, this is a self-assessment, thus possibly a faulty one;   5. The professor is welcoming and has a nice personality (I got this information from a friend that has a friend who was a phd student in the same university as Prof. M. and who talked to him personally);   6. He has supervised* undergraduate students in the past (about five years ago);  So,    1. should I talk to Prof. M. personally or by email?   2. should I mention a paper he wrote that I find particularly interesting and ask if he would accept advising me to do similar research?

This is the sort of thing you want to do in person, not by mail/email. You certainly won't get a positive answer via an email exchange. You might get an invitation to visit, but that puts you face-to-face in any case.  This is the sort of thing you want to do in conjunction with an advocate/intermediary. If you were already established in \"your\" college, one of your professors would be good for doing that. Especially since the prof once studied there. But if you have a current teacher who knows this person (or is known) they might be willing to intervene on your behalf, perhaps even accompanying you on a visit to the other university.  I'm not sure that waiting until you are established at university is a good thing or not. You won't have a lot of time to become recognized before you need to make the contact. But it would give you the potential for finding an intermediary.  You will need to convince the prof that you have unique skills and that it would be a missed opportunity not to work with you. That is a pretty steep climb. It would help if some of your research interests align. So you need to demonstrate that you know something of the research of the prof and how you might fit in.  But I also have a small wonder about why you chose the university you did, rather than the other one. You would maximize your chance by going there instead.  Don't worry about being/seeming awkward. Lots of people in academia are likewise.  "

There are issues of power, context, and precision; but adept researchers are readily throwing the baby out with the bathwater. Stop for a moment and think: \"Do not reject H_0\" means that the confidence limits include the null hypothesized value(s): 0 for differences or 1 for ratios. So what?  1) Was this study sufficiently powered or is it a complete shot-in-the-dark? Large, untenable confidence intervals can represent a crappy study or it can reflect substantial heterogeneity in the population. Were there issues with recruitment or compliance? Did you need to compensate people better? Did you administer an existing instrument and if so, did you assess yourself or the patients to be sure the wording is clear? If it's a trainwreck study you can focus on lessons learned. E.g.  > we recruited 30 people based on an incorrect power calculation, our effect > estimate had a much smaller magnitude than was noted in previous literature. > This is a cause for some concern given our calculation was based on previous > research which claimed that...  2) Is the CI narrowly on 0 or 1 excluding all other research? This is a significant finding because it is inconsistent with other literature. There's a whole field of research devoted to determining the effects of publication bias. Funnel Plots show the expected distribution of effects from meta- analyses. If the distribution is shifted with a gap at H0 it gives some pause as to whether the state of evidence is exaggerated by filtering out null findings? Important landmark research has been able to conclusively say, \"No. A certain treatment does not / cannot cause a difference.  3) Is the CI wide but centered on a result which confirms previous research. For instance:  > A 5,000 person study of salt reduction found that the HR for MI was 0.95 > 95%CI 0.92, 0.99 (p < 0.05). A confirmation study of 100 found a HR for MI > of 0.95 95% CI 0.5, 1.45. (p > 0.05).  Importantly these studies agree 100%.  "

There are statistical issues at play for sure, I don't want to dissuade you but you need to make sure that you did the math (including data collection and methodology are correct), but you can write a very powerful paper by comparing two methods. Something like:    * Method A, which is cheap and easy to collect data on but we have concerns that it will contain bias gives a positive result.    * On the other hand Method B that is difficult and expensive to collect data on but is far more thorough and not expected to contain bias gives a negative result.    * Therefore, researchers should avoid using method A.  I'd be willing to bet that you could get a journal to publish a paper that is written like that, given that all of the analysis, data collection, etc. was above board, let alone get a good grade in the class.

In fact, there's a strong case to be made for taking four years and accomplishing as much as you can. In PhD admissions, you'll be competing against people who were also ahead of the game in their first few semesters, but stayed in school and kept gathering feathers in their cap. Some of these feathers will be more impressive than graduating early. Also, more time as an undergrad means more chances for professors to get to know you, and this is what translates into good letters of recommendation.  Now, that is all general advice. Factors particular to your situation may tilt the balance in favor of it making sense to graduate early. I would recommend talking this over with your professors, because they know your record and can give you realistic advice about your prospects after graduating in X semesters, for various values of X.

        "answer_body": "  Some things I would immediately question if I received an applicant who was in your situation:    1. Getting into graduate school is a different beast than succeeding in graduate school. As someone tasked with reviewing your application, one of the things I need to consider is how successful a candidate will be in completing a degree. I need to assess mathematical maturity as part of that assessment. I would question if a student who took as many math classes as possible, as fast as possible, really has the academic maturity to succeed in a graduate program. Graduate school is much more than just burning through classes as fast as possible. We have had a few \"younglings\" who have tried to do our graduate program and they invariably lacked the maturity to succeed as a graduate student. We have stopped being so impressed by students who are fast graduates. (And have actually begun avoiding them admittedly).     2. How did you manage to take 4-5 math classes a semester while also fulfilling general education requirements? In the US, most schools require 120 credits to graduate (with each math class being ~3 credits). If you did this in 5 semesters, you really took 20 credits a semester while at the same time fulfilling all prerequisites? Someone who took all three linear algebra classes in one semester likely did not really retain what they need to (and possibly circumvented some registration policies).     3. If you have a gap year between your graduate degree and your undergrad, what were you doing during the gap year?    4. Can someone who graduated 2 years early really establish a relationship with letter of recommendation authors?  "

If I've improperly tagged or placed this question, such that it need be closed or held, I apologize.  Continuing, I'll be brief (To be so, I will mostly omit the anecdotal lead. At anyone's request, however, I'm more than happy to explain.*):  I'm 21. I dropped out of art school during 2016, have graduated high school in 2015, returning in 2017, getting expelled a week later, enrolling in community college classes a few months later, dropping out some weeks later, enrolling at and attending a second art school in 2018 (spring semester), flunking out of my financial aid and scholarship.  A series of events brought me to physics and mathematics. Manic obsession mildly describes my rapture.  I have dreams, lurid, about sequent calculus. I'm a quite, quite well- practiced autodidact. I read a lot. Springer's (among many others') Graduate Texts in physics, mathematics, computer science. I have exhausted all of MIT's Open Courseware offered for physics and mathematics at the undergraduate and graduate levels.  I have realized only how little I know, how far I've still to go -- the limits of autodidactic way.  I have pre-calculus -- twice. I have never taken a physics class. (1: Understanding MIT's 'open courseware,' by some, are considered 'course', I'm using the term strictly for that of a credit granting environment).  I need to earn a PhD. I need to participate.  The dilemma: Getting in the door. I, no matter how competent or incompetent, have nothing to show for it. I'm clearly not a competitive candidate (if not an all together joke) for any undergraduate program of the formal and/or physical sciences.  The question(s): how, given these circumstances, can I (be it conventionally or unconventionally) become competitive (at the undergraduate level of the US college system)? If that is too subjective - where might I find resources, if they exist, that will best allow me to answer (successfully) the above question?

What you _can_ manage is how much of your time you devote to the project and how you deal with your other tasks in that context.

I was coming from a psychology background, and my classmates had backgrounds ranging from biology to computer science to mathematics to pre-med. You will be at a disadvantage given your relative weakness in biology, but not a very significant one. Your math skills from the bachelors in engineering will serve you well as you learn about neural and systems dynamics, and the chemistry you learned will be of immeasurable use in understanding the biochemistry of the nervous system.  Given your background, you should definitely be able to apply directly to a MS or PhD program without having to retake (too much) undergraduate coursework. Do note that you may be able to get into the program with the caveat that you will be required to take some undergraduate courses during your first year; this was a common practice in my program. Given how long it takes to complete your PhD anyway, it should not delay you much, if at all.    * Coming from an IT/engineering background, you may be interested in [computational neuroscience](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_neuroscience), a subfield which attempts to understand how the brain works\u2014both at a systems-level (i.e., whole brain) and cell-level (i.e., individual neurons)\u2014using computational models. There are [entire](http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/research/areas/compneuro/) [departments](http://www.eecs.mit.edu/bioeecs/CompNeurosci.html) [dedicated](http://www.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/martinos/research/index.php) to such research; it's a fairly large field.    * Your action items listed above are all excellent ideas, and should serve you very well. The only suggestion I would add is to simply google the term [\"neuroscience research labs\"](http://www.google.com/search?q=neuroscience+research+labs) and begin browsing around the web to see what types of research is being performed. As you search, google again using narrower terms, to see how broad each subfield is. Consider writing down some of the schools that house labs that sound interesting to you for future reference.  "

      "question_body": "  I just graduated in May 2018 with an undergraduate bachelor degree in Computer Science from a pretty good university. During my time at the university, I always had aspirations of attending graduate school for a Masters (as a terminal degree). I had considered studying Computer Science, but during my final semester, I enjoyed the 400-level \"Statistics and Probability I\" course immensely that I had to take, making me re-think my decision of area of study in graduate school.  I focused mainly on my undergraduate courses along with becoming a course assistant (i.e. like a TA) for a Computer Architecture course for three semesters. I did not do any research or work closely with a professor in a related field while obtaining my degree, something I strongly wish I had done. Although, I have done two computer science-related internships in my final two summers as an undergraduate.  On top of this, my cumulative GPA feels incredibly mediocre at just a 3.34.  I am left with thinking of what the best possible path from here is, in the hopes of obtaining a Masters in Statistics. I have a few options I am looking at:  1.) Graduate schools across the board require letters of recommendations. Yes, I do have the professor I was a course assistant under, another professor that has gotten to know me well through course work, and internship mentors that have seen my industry intership work. However, I have been in talks with a professor on a PhD candidate board that notes that letters of recs for graduate school should come from professors you have worked closely with (i.e. through research) ( _he notes no distinction from masters vs. PhD_ ).  **Should I look for a research assistant position at a university institution before applying for graduate school (i.e. spend about a year doing research - spring and fall) in hopes of gaining experience and having a professor get to know me in an academia sense?**  2.) **Should I apply to a Post-Baccalaureate program in statistics to demonstrate a better GPA and to find a prospecting professor to do research with?** I have the mathematics foundation (e.g. Calc 1, 2, & 3 and linear algebra), however, I obviously do not have a lot of statistics under me (e.g. one course as noted above).  I am leaning towards #1, however, I see the benefits of #2 too.  If anyone has any other recommendations, please send them my way. I am a bit nervous about wasting any time any one area, unless it is the right move. I would greatly appreciate feedback!  ",

        "answer_body": "  There is a big difference between a Masters program and a PhD program, and there is also a difference between a Masters program by coursework, and a Masters program by research. Suitability of programs like these, and their entry requirements, generally depend on the specifics of the program and the entry standards of the university. Having said this, I will try to give some general guidance on this matter.  **Master of Statistics (coursework-based):** For a student such as yourself, who has an undergraduate degree in a quantitative area outside of statistics (but with a small amount of statistics in that program), a Masters degree by coursework would be an obvious place to start. A coursework-based Master of Statistics program is generally a good fit for someone coming over from another quantitative degree. Indeed, these programs are usually _designed_ for students who did not do an undergraduate degree in statistics, but have enough background in mathematics to be able to learn the subject more rapidly than would occur in an undergraduate degree. (Student who already have an undergraduate degree in statistics may be able to jump this hurdle and go straight into a PhD program.)  Although it varies by university, entry into a coursework-based Master of Statistics program would not usually require an undergraduate degree in the same field, or any research experience. It would usually be sufficient to have an undergraduate degree in a quantitative subject where you have done the core maths requirements (calculus, linear algebra, etc.) that would allow you to understand graduate-level statistics courses. If this is a program of interest to you, my advice would be to make inquiries with the universities that are suitable to you, and find out the entry requirements for their programs.  **Master of Statistics (research-based):** Research-based programs generally have higher entry expectations than coursework-based programs, so for these programs it might be hard to get in (or to do the work) if you do not have a solid undergraduate education in statistics. For a student like yourself, the more usual path would be to start in a coursework-based masters program first, and then progress to research once you have done enough courses to give you a good grounding in the subject. In some masters programs there is a combination of coursework and then research. The coursework comes first and then the research occurs when you have a solid grounding in the field.  **Putting the cart before the horse:** I am a bit surprised at your suggestion that you would pursue a research assistant position as a means of trying to get entry to a masters program. You already have some experience as a research assistant, so what you are lacking is not this experience, but rather, coursework in statistics. In your situation I would think that you could apply directly for course-work based programs in statistics, and this would then be a lead-in to later research programs.  "

So, to put in in a succinct manner: As a undergraduate doing research, **you need to be able to find solutions to the problems** your advisor assigns to you. Most of them would be of the sort \"implement _this_ \" or \"find which one of known methods to do _that_ better works with our current data\".

Which makes me think that the adviser plays the crucial role of the success of a beginner researcher.  _Background._ During last two years of studies I tried to do some research. I approached a prof who I considered among the most active researches on the faculty, not very young / not old, who's research was in the field (some branch of cs|applied mathematics) which I was and still am interested in. He proposed me several topics and I picked one. I tried to produce the result and failed. The difficulty was that: first, I lacked some necessary knowledge, there was no actual \"problem\", rather \"try to get some theoretical result, connected to a certain algorithm\". It was very frustrating experience because neither I understood why the topic is important (so I had no real passion) nor the prof had anything particular in mind and was not researching that topic so I was unable to get any research skill from collaboration. Next year I have chosen another topic with same prof (I thought that the topic was to blame) with almost the same result. So I don't have any successful research experience yet. For this reason instead of applying to a PhD program directly I have decided to do a Research Masters (in Europe). No that I am in the first year of masters I want to do some research.  _The question._ I am not sure if the problem lies with me or I am just having a bad luck with advisers. I believe that there are geniuses who can do self- motived research on their own and who do not actually need an adviser. Is it the case for other students too? How can I actually have a research experience which fits my level?  ",

Whether it is publishable is debatable, but I would consider the advance of the research skill a very positive result. As with all skills, it takes practice and you shouldn't expect to get it right (i.e. groundbreaking publishable results) the first (few) time(s).  Second, if you were stuck for a year without adjustment, that is a problem, not with research per se, but probably with a combination of supervision and communication. You need to set smaller milestones and adjust the course of your work accordingly. In order to do that, you must communicate with your adviser about the problems you are facing. His experience and knowledge should be able to nudge you in the right direction. However, do keep in mind that this is research, and a vital part of it is getting moving again after you've been stuck by yourself.

        "answer_body": "  **For a student in the U.S. system** , the common academic route to PhD admission in biomedical sciences is to obtain a bachelors degree and then to apply directly for PhD programs. For competitive programs, research experience is very important for applications, and so many applicants do additional research in between their bachelors degree and PhD applications: working in academic labs, participating in post-baccalaureate programs, or sometimes participating in a program that offers a masters degree (particularly if you are taking a more interdisciplinary route), but the masters degree is not usually a strict requirement for a PhD program in biomedical sciences.  Masters degrees are uncommon as a goal in biomedical sciences, and many institutions do not even offer them as a program that accepts applicants. Instead, masters degrees are sometimes awarded to PhD candidates who choose to end their studies early, or they consist of add-on programs (almost like a more developed 'minor') meant to accompany a PhD and are applied for simultaneously. Of course this can vary with the exact institution, and varies in other fields.  **For a student outside the U.S. system, things can be more complicated.** As discussed in the comments by BrianBorchers, U.S. institutions vary in how they treat bachelors degrees completed in other countries. A 3 year program (an actual 3 year program, not a 4 year program completed early) may not qualify. In that case, your best option may be to get a masters degree in the educational system you got your bachelors degree in, but this is _something you should discuss with individual programs you may be interested in applying to_ in order to find out their specific rules: there is no guideline that will apply to every school or every program. Alternatively, programs may instead have a course of study in mind that you will have to have completed before your application is considered: it will be more important that you can show you have completed those courses in your studies rather than the specific length of your degree.  Most major PhD programs in the U.S. are going to have a web presence with rules and admissions requirements posted, as well as support staff for the program. You should read these as thoroughly as you can, and then ask additional questions to the staff.  "

It will both advance your research substantially, which will yield some useful benefits in the future regardless of whether you meet this particular deadline, and teach you a lot about yourself and what you\u2019re capable of. In my opinion, most people (especially younger, less established ones) use maybe 15% of their true intellectual capacity. Learning how to make the most of your potential is an incredibly important life skill that separates almost all successful people from everyone else, and trying to meet a crazy, impossible-looking deadline is a fantastic way to get on the path to acquiring this skill.  Finally, I don\u2019t want to be guilty of giving you any more reasons to procrastinate by giving you long psychology blogs to read, but [here](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/10/why-procrastinators-procrastinate.html) is something that might give you a bit of hope/inspiration. Good luck!  "

So I would view any research project as worthwhile. You could find:    * you really do like research and find a new area that you'd want to pursue.   * you don't like the project but want to try something else.   * you really don't like research.  Any of these would be a notable and valuable end result. So don't worry about getting into machine learning later on if you can't get it into it now. Doing research in something that has piqued your interest (at least temporarily) is all that really matters, especially early on in your career.  "

How can I take a win-win with both; that is how to find 'smaller' unsolved problems like the problems students publish papers on, as an independent researcher when nobody willing to share them?

        "answer_body": "  Maybe the first thing to keep in mind is **be patient.** Learning mathematics and finding good problems take time, and you're still very young.  In math, at the undergraduate level, the most important thing to becoming a good researcher is to learn a lot of math. At this level, really the only reason to do research is for fun. Your goal should not be to get new results-- you might or you might not--but your goal should be to understand things and enjoy the process.  Thus my recommendation for doing research on your own is: _just learn a bunch of things that seem interesting, and when questions naturally come to you, explore them._ You will probably stumble on to many ideas for research this way, and it doesn't matter if they have been studied/solved before or not (my experience: usually they have, but occasionally you find something new).  If you really want to do something new, it helps immensely to have an experienced mentor guiding you. They can tell you what is known/what isn't, suggest relevant references and teach you some basic techniques.  It's unfortunate that none of your professors seem willing to work with you now, but there could be various reasons for that, such as being busy and not knowing your abilities/background. I can't guarantee this, but there's a good chance that if you excel in their courses, one of them may be willing to provide you some informal guidance.  Finally, to directly answer the titular question here are some specific suggestions:    * Try reading articles in undergraduate-oriented journals like _The American Mathematical Monthly_ , _College Mathematics Journal_ or _Involve_. Many of the research articles are readable by undergraduates, and implicitly or explicitly suggest projects suitable for undergraduates.    * You can use _Mathematics Stack Exchange_ and _MathOverflow_ to try find out what is known about a problem you're wondering about. Also browsing some of the questions and answers will introduce you to some unsolved problems.    * If you read an article you find really interesting, and you have some definite ideas about a project, you can try emailing one of the authors for their thoughts.    * In the US, we have summer programs like REUs (Research Experience for Undergraduates) at various institutions. You might look to see if there are any similar opportunities in our around your country.  "

For some reason, sometime throughout the summer, that grad student began making derisive comments and began to devalue my work.  After I'm away, since I've barely interacted with the PI, that grad student will tell the PI about my work when the PI has to write my letter of recommendation. I figured that since I have done valuable work, it would be a good idea to tell the PI myself about the specifics of the work I've done before I go, so that he's aware. So I asked the PI if he would mind meeting at some point before I leave, and he agreed, but seemed annoyed at the request, citing that he was just going to hear what the grad student had to say.  Have I just ended up in a bad group? Is there any way to approach this situation so that the PI is aware of my work and gives me an appropriate letter? I'm afraid the grad student will say something ridiculous like that the other undergraduate did most of the work.  ",

        "answer_body": "  In my experience (which, beware, is in pure mathematics) a faculty member has very little incentive to describe undergraduate research done under their supervision in negative terms: it is hard for the reader of such a letter not to view the student's failure as _their_ failure. Also in my experience (which, beware...) it is quite common for an undergraduate working over a short period (like the summer) not to end up contributing anything much to the larger research project, so that even this outcome need not be described in negative terms: after all, the student still got the experience. I am aware that in the laboratory sciences a student is working on a piece of \"the real project\" much more so than for student research in pure mathematics, but still....would an experienced PI really give a critical piece of their project to an all but unknown person? Again, if they do so and it works out badly, it seems to reflect badly on them.  All this is to say that I find it unlikely that you will get a negative recommendation. What you risk getting is a recommendation that is not positive enough to help you with your graduate school applications. If that happens, and if as you say you did good work over the summer (both your grad student supervisor and your PI are much more experienced in this regard than you, so without further information we have to at least contemplate the possibility that their judgment, rather than yours, is correct), then yes -- you probably did end up in a bad group.  What can you do? Well, you booked an appointment with your PI, and I think that's wise. During that appointment your goals are (i) to the extent that seems reasonable and reasonably polite, make your case that you did good work over the summer and (ii) suss out your PI's opinion of the work to see what kind of letter you will get. Here I will observe that if you are overly aggressive or defensive on point (i), that might hurt you on point (ii): the PI may not want to give their honest opinion if they have already had to argue with you too much. If it turns out that the PI has a not very positive opinion of your work, then indeed you may not want to get a letter from them. That's a bit of a shame, but the lack of it should not really hurt your application, and an equivalent way of saying that the PI's opinion of your work is unreasonably low is that all your other academic work will be evaluated much more positively by others...so go with these other, better recommendations.  Anyway, all this is just one summer: if you stick around, there will be others...Good luck.  "

Discuss your plan and involve your supervisor in your preparation of the manuscript. The reason for the first is that statistically significant results and a potential research gap aren't sufficient in and of themselves in guaranteeing acceptance. The reason for the second is because there's more to submission of a paper than simply writing it. Your supervisor will be able to provide you with guidance.   2. Read and dissect some papers from the journal to which you plan to submit. This will orient you about the style of writing, formatting, referencing, etc. Certainly, read the instructions to authors, but also be guided by good samples from the same journal.   3. Prepare emotionally for the review process and the decision. First time authors are often surprised by the delays, unhelpfulness or viciousness inherent in the peer review system.

        "answer_body": "  Most economics journals published by Elsevier are pretty high quality indeed. They are very competitive too, even the ones on the very bottom of the rating may publish only a fifth of the papers they receive. Additionally, it is highly unlikely that they will accept a paper without revision. Review + revision + review of revision + ... usually takes more than a year, sometimes several. I've seen so many economics papers that were publish 5 years after they were originally submitted. On top of that, each economic journal normally has a subscriber base that is interested in specific conclusions and implementability of results and editors prefer the papers to fit that scope, revised if necessary, trying not to compromise scientific rigor in the process, of course.  With that being said, I'd definitely give it a try, but don't expect it to be published until graduation. Even if it is rejected with some constructive feedback, you will learn a lot. Often times you can revise the paper and publish it in a lesser journal. If you can team up with someone senior to help you see it through, good. If not, you can go solo just as well. Economics is notorious for young individualistic researchers who made great contributions all by themselves. The drawback is that it does take a long time.  On a side note, economics is a field where you got to publish, regardless of whether you plan to work in academia or business. You will have to make that journey anyway. Starting early and setting an ambitious goal is not a bad strategy, especially if already have some good data ready.  "

But it is also possible that the authors already publish a license to use and extend.  The only other issue is to find a journal or conference that will accept the paper.  I would suggest that part of your paper discuss the earlier work in some detail and the results that it provides. All properly cited. Then you can discuss your new approach and how it improves on the original.  It would also be good to explore alternate data sets to give yourself assurance that your result isn't too narrow or tailored to the specific data set of the original paper. You can even do a comparison on a range of data to get true confidence in the value of your work.

      "question_body": "  I'm currently an undergrad who has been working at this lab for 1 year. In the beginning, I was pretty slow with research and I still make mistakes sometimes. For instance, it took me 4 months to get a western to properly work and 1 month to properly clone something. I'm not as bright as the other interns, but I learned a lot this 1 year about techniques and scientific knowledge. Granted, I don't know if I'm 'competent' enough for research.  Anyways, my research mentor (post-doc) left for a new position, and now I'm pretty much without a mentor. I emailed my PI for a new mentor assignment if possible a week ago, no response. My former mentor emails my PI and gets no response. Now, I decide to **follow-up** with him yesterday - still no response. So in total, 3 emails (2 from me, 1 from my former mentor) sent to my PI about this topic in the last week.  I'm not the closest to my PI. He seems always busy and I haven't spoken to him very often. However, it's unlike him to take a very long time to respond to emails, as he usually responds within 1-2 days.  Does this mean I've been ghosted by my PI/given a boot from lab? My former mentor told me that my PI would be willing to let me continue working, but I don't know if he was just saying that.  I'm not sure if I should reach out to other post-docs/grad-students in the lab and ask them if they can be my new supervisor mentor. So far, I haven't had much work to do so I've been staying back home and reading papers the lab has published/to see if any of interest. The other people in the lab familiar with my name; I hope they're not thinking about how stupid I am since I did make lots of dumb mistakes. I know the lab manager doesn't like me that much (one time I was giving a lab presentation and she was shaking her head), and usually she's the de facto person people turn for conflicts such as these.

One thing you can do with others in the lab is to explore their experiences. Are they similar to yours or quite different. If different, try to figure out why. Some of what you have experienced may not be your fault at all, but accept that some of it may also be.  But you don't need to call yourself dumb. That is a mistake that can only work against you.

Yet, for yourself, you suffered from a lack of overall organization of different components in the job (Reversed Magician). On top of that, there were a lot of fast-to-react situations thrown to you. Yet, as time went on, it diminished (8 of Wands, Reversed).  Tuning into now, the project overall is not reciprocating your love. If anything it's refusing to act out its displease (Knight of Cups, Reversed). And yet, from your own perspective, you are feeling contented (Nine of Cups), somewhat unaware of the overall situation. Perhaps you thought you have improved enough, or even you did, the project staff are not seeing it.  In the middle of all this, someone is doing something illogical or betraying. It could be your supervisor did not leave in a good relationship with the team, or there are negative stories going on behind you (7 of Swords); the situation you're facing now may not be just about your performance, but more of a system of issues.  Either way, in my opinion, the next key player would be likely be a person who has abundant control of the system, or likely a female (Queen of Swords). This seems to point to your lab manager. The outcome of the event is simply a guess, but a 3 of Wands indicates you'd gain a better balance in terms of your passion and interest. But either way, it's a strong \"new journey\" card so my guess is you'll join another lab, realizing that the good fit was not there.  * * *  Overall, my blanket thought is that you may have some distorted sense of where you're at and what you skill level is. You might be using very small signs (like the manager shaking her head) and extrapolated that into some opinions without merit. From the spread, and from the story you told, the lab manager is logically the next person to talk to, and you'll just have to prepare for a potentially harsh review. Use this conversation to i) get an overall evaluation for yourself, and ii) ask for recommendations on research/career paths. In any case, you'll grow; and if they end up letting you go, this would be a great opportunity to let them know that hanging people dry is not a good way to manage human resources.  It's just a little thought practice of mine so if I misspoke please don't mind me. But I hope this helps, and I wish you'd be able to get the positive parts from whatever outcome that would unfold!

      "question_body": "  In the program of CS, in which I am currently working, we have a group of students that for ending their Honour\u00b4s degree they should submit and present a research in the field; limited to their undergraduate knowledge. The process is that they get an adviser, read some papers, ending up with an article that describe their experiments and discuss their results. After that, they should make a small dissertation about their research findings. Before going to this stage, their research work is revised by two lecturers to give their insights about this work. Regarding this procedure I have found, that in some occasions, the following occur:    1. The adviser of the student agrees that the current research work is adequate to the educational level, that is an undergraduate level. It is not a master\u00b4s or a PhD.   2. One of the reviewers asks for modifications in the research made by the student, that in the majority of the cases, would imply to make deep modifications in the research work that would take more effort and, of course, time allotted for the student.      3. In some cases, and this usually occurs in the dissertation, the questions asked from some of the other lecturers are very biased to their expert field. Making the student to feel discouraged of their work.  I mean how to deal with these situations, in this cases the adviser feel bad for the student also, but there are so many details that in my personal opinion is hard for the student to cope at this level. For example, imagine that a student X has chosen the topic of using neural networks for predicting diabetes treatment outcome. The student has made a literature review, obtained some datasets and perform some tests with the build model. Then, according to the adviser the paper is fine, and in the dissertation this happens:    * Lecturer X suggest to use GA for feature selection instead of PCA. If this observation is not raised the student can pass, but with a minimum grade.   * Lecturer Y, to test the knowledge of the student, starts to ask specific details of the architecture of the neural network. Lets suppose that Y is a mathematician, then he will start asking about what is the reason of the vanishing gradient issue and how to solve it. So this was a detail that the student has not considered, and according to this lecturer the student should fail.  So, what can we do to ameliorate this situation? Because at the end is bringing discomfort to either students, advisers and lecturers.  Thanks  ",

In my experience either adviser steps in and explains the topic to the lecturer X and Y in front of everyone because undergraduate students get petrified against hostile lecturers and they cause more damage or advisers meet with lecturer X and Y behind closed doors to explain why the research is good enough for an undergrad student.  From my point of view Lecturer X and Y should have been in the loop before the dissertation either by making them advisers of the undergrad student or by asking their input before dissertation.  Keep in mind if a lecturer thinks that he/she is an expert about a topic most likely he/she will get hostile if you keep them out of the loop until dissertation. They are simply challenging advisers about the topic.  If this is the case, protect your undergraduate students.

But there are some lesser things that you could, perhaps, do to make the problem go away. Maybe this isn't possible, but your staff should discuss these and all other options.  First, is that you can decouple the \"advice\" given by the reviewers from the grading/marking of the work. The actual marking and assigning of grades should be someone with an overall perspective on the course and its students, not the parochial views of some specialist, no matter how skilled.  The second thing is to have a session before the work goes out to the reviewers in which you are clear to the students about the marking (if you can get it changed) but also that they are likely to get weird, even hostile reviews. The students should be clear that while they need to be respectful and to consider any proposed changes or extensions that such things won't affect their marks. But of course, if project revision is part of the exercise the students will need to show that they have considered suggestions even when they must be rejected.  Another thing you might be able to do is to give the reviewers some training. Perhaps they don't understand the requirements at the level the students are at - undergraduate. Perhaps they don't understand their role - helping, not abusing, students. You can probably do this with written material given to potential advisors at the time of selection. A face to face meeting of all reviewers would be preferable if possible. That way you get feedback on the attitudes of the individuals. If you can fiddle with the grading scheme, you can make it clear to the reviewers that while their reviews will be considered in grading, they won't be definitive.  Finally, you may need to do a better job of matching students and reviewers as well as rejecting reviewers who have behaved badly in the past.  "

        "answer_body": "  I think that not having undergraduate research experience wouldn't be disqualifying in any field. The best place to learn, however, is from the admissions system of a university you are considering attending. The expectations can vary.  The doctorate, in fact, is where you normally get qualified as a researcher. Masters programs will often, but not necessarily, have a research component, depending on field of study. But even at that level, the usual goal is to produce practitioners of an art/craft/profession rather than researchers. If practitioners don't normally need to do research, the Master's degree may not have much of a research component.  Another issue is \"What constitutes research?\". If you help out, for pay or credit on someone else's research you may learn relatively little about conducting research, even though you are listed as a co-author on some publications. At the minimum it is hoped that you learn a bit about common processes and the tools and techniques, but _the research would then be driven by the ideas of others_. Perhaps in Chemical Engineering, having this basic knowledge of the tools would be expected but unlikely to be gained in an undergraduate education.  On the other hand, at many universities, the competition for enrollment in any given program can be fierce and some research background may be taken as a plus, separating the \"obviously qualified\" from the \"rest of the best.\" The timing of application can also have an effect. If the country has a large need and few applicants you will have a better chance than in the opposite situation.  Whether to take a separate Master's level degree or not, depends on the university and possibly the country. Taking a Master's that doesn't have a research component won't necessarily help. Also, many doctoral programs will accept students with only an undergraduate degree and, perhaps, award a Master's along the way. In that case, expect the overall program to be a bit longer than if you start with an appropriate Master's, of course.  Finally, if you take a Master's at one university, you still need to contend with admission requirements at a second university if you switch. In those places in which programs are well coordinated this may be simple. In others, not so simple, so study the issue in advance wherever you are.  The best advice is to look at the requirements of a few interesting universities. If you seem to have the qualifications, explore further, perhaps by corresponding with the department you wish to join or the university itself. If you are encouraged to apply then you probably have the basic qualifications, though you still face the competition.  "

      "question_body": "  I am an Indian undergraduate engineering student in electronics and communication engineering. I recently had a conversation (via email) with a professor at the Royal Holloway, University of London. The professor works in my subject of interest, and so I had mailed him asking whether internship opportunities are available for the next summer. I also mentioned that I'm willing to self-fund as far as travel and living expenses are concerned. He said that it _might_ be possible to arrange for an internship, however, he's not sure if he's allowed to _not_ pay me. Naturally, he is a very busy person and told me that it might take him some time to gather more information about my situation. Meanwhile, he asked me to look out for scholarships/bursaries which might be available to me (during the internship period).  Now, being an Indian, I'm not very sure how these things work in the UK, nor am I particularly certain about what he meant by _bursaries/scholarships_. I did search the net for \"funding+internship+UK\", but couldn't find anything relevant to my situation. Most of the scholarship schemes I found are meant for undergraduate or graduate students who are going to study there for a period of 3 or 4 years, or for postgraduate researchers. I already mailed the Royal Holloway's international student support and the [British Council](https://www.britishcouncil.in/) and am waiting for a response from them. Is there anything else which I can possibly do from my end?  To summarize, basically my question is two-fold:    1. Are scholarships/bursaries (whatever that means) for _research internships_ (in the UK), at the undergraduate level, available for non-UK students?    2. If yes, how should I go about looking for them? What are the places I should search first? Whom should I contact first?  P.S: I must clearly mention that I already thoroughly searched my [own university's website](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/) but it seems that they don't have any funding schemes to support abroad internships. So, probably I'll need to find an external source for funding.  * * *  Update: The British Council replied that they do not have anything specific for my situation at the moment, however, I should keep an eye on the \"scholarships tab\" on their website, for future opportunities.

It's not clear to me you want to self-fund or to find a scholarship.  Tax-free scholarships are only for enrolled students. And you can't just enroll in an undergraduate program in the UK, as they require A-level etc.  I think what the professor meant was to \"hire\" you as research assistant without salary. But he was not sure if it was legal to do.  Your best chance is to look for some exchange programs, e.g. funding from Indian government etc.  You should also look at other countries. But I would say your chance are very small. Internship positions are often for people with intention to pursue PhD at the same lab. And in the Europe, it is requires Master's degree for a PhD  "

Your past research will certainly strengthen your application, even if it's not in the subfield you aspire to study in graduate school. Grad schools look for students interested in and able to carry out research, and a lot of those skills are transferable across disciplines and certainly subfields. It's also perfectly normal to change your research interests during undergrad (or be constrained in topic choice by what faculty in your department are working on or any other number of factors).  > [...] would it just be better to apply to a PhD that relates to my my > published papers?

Many well-regarded schools **don't introduce such coursework until the third year** , opting to spend four full semesters on calculus. Sometimes the ultimate or penultimate semester is replaced by an intro to proofs, discrete mathematics, or linear algebra course, but the effect is the same. One of the major draws for me going to my undergraduate institution was that the norm was for mathematics majors to do real analysis their second year, with exceptional students starting little Rudin on day 1.  The extra year of advanced mathematics courses will be a huge boost to your application. You can increase this effect by demonstrating breadth and depth that other students won't be able to match. If you spend your first three years accomplishing the theoretical coursework that most students do, and then spend your fourth year taking, e.g., the graduate sequence in algebra, graduate courses in discrete mathematics and algorithms, and advanced undergraduate courses in functional analysis and algebraic topology then you've effectively demonstrated your ability to succeed in graduate level coursework. You'll also have a far deeper understanding of algebra and it's applications to computer science than the vast majority of applicants, and taking more advanced courses in analysis and topology lets you show that your advanced status isn't shallow or restricted to one area. And just in terms of a numbers game, you'll have ~12 advanced mathematics courses to other people's six (please correct these numbers if they don't make sense; I've only attended quarter systems schools and am not 100% on what numbers are normal).  Breadth and depth of coursework is a commonly used proxy for future mathematics success, and if you're able to take these fourth year graduate courses with professors you had already, then in their letters of recommendation they'll be able to talk about how you excelled in their previous courses and that they're excited to have you doing graduate work and that they expect you to succeed. Comments like that can go a long ways.  I don't think that you should be too caught up about the reputation of your university. In my experience talking to people who have served on admissions committees (note: I have never done so personally) is that, if they explicitly think about the reputation of a university at all, it is in **very broad strokes that encompass dozens if not more universities per tier**.  If this is an issue that concerns you particularly, you might find better success asking people at your institution who are more familiar with where you go to school than I am. One thing you should definitely **ask is about what graduate schools other students like you have attended** recently. This last bit is very important as, especially at a larger school, your outcomes and those of the average student are likely to be far apart.  In addition to talking to members of the mathematics faculty, you should also consider talking to any **CS Theory faculty** that you have. If you suppositions are correct, they're probably as likely or more likely to have written letters of recommendation for students who went on to top mathematics PhD programs. A sizable chunk, if not most, CS Theory people have mathematics PhDs rather than CS PhDs.  "

One advantage you have is that, at a small place, you probably have good access to your professors and they know your work pretty well.  First, check to see what connections your own professors have to other schools. These could be places that they went to school, or personal contacts at conferences or co-authors of papers. Enlist the help of your profs in promoting your candidacy.  Second, find out if other students from your current place have gone to universities you would find interesting. Find out how they did. If someone before you has set a good example at another university it can work in your favor.  Failing that, write application materials stressing heavily what you can do, mostly by stressing what you have done. Ask your professors to analyze these to see how your projects and performance will be perceived.  And since you have a bit of time, do what you can to do interesting things that others might find impressive.  In general, though, the reputation of your current institution is only one thing among many that will be used in the selection process.

It may be, in fact, that the professor saw the problem but not the solution and needed it himself.  In fact, it is fairly common for a dissertation advisor for the doctorate to provide the problems to his/her students that result in their degrees. That isn't universal, but happens regularly in some fields.  On the other hand, in some fields (mathematics, say) the ability to ask the right questions is extremely important - more so than finding the eventual answers in many cases. But to be a complete researcher you need to be able to do both. However, it isn't expected that you get this ability naturally. So, in a way, the professor is \"kick starting\" you on your way to being a good researcher.  Of course, you can also say in the paper that the problem was proposed by Professor X of University Y. The professor can give you advice about the advisability of that, of course.  Moreover, the question posed by the professor got you thinking. You got to thinking about the solution. But I also guess that it got you thinking about the _next_ question that needs to be asked. If so, you are on your way.  * * *  I should also note, for completeness, that there have been occasions in which someone has posted important unsolved problems as \"exercises\" in books and elsewhere. This has sometimes been done without comment. The idea is to get the problem out to a wide variety of people who know the topic and might, somehow, have the insight to solve it. Don Knuth, for example, has done this in Computer Science:[The Art of Computer Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming).  "

If you want to completely cover your bases, it would be appropriate to ask that professor for further advice just like you have asked us:  > I am new to research and unsure of proper conventions. Since you suggested > the problem, do you think I need to acknowledge your contribution in some > way? If so, how?  Answering these sorts of questions is exactly what an academic advisor is for.

For the second approach, you still need to convince the university that you are a good prospect to learn the required material in a reasonable time.  Someone with a STEM degree is a much better prospect because they have learned and applied relatively advanced mathematics. Most universities will be able to fill their PhD program with people who already have at least a bachelor's degree in the actual subject, and so meet most of the prerequisites for the graduate courses.  Some universities do not enforce prerequisites on PhD coursework if you have the knowledge and skills.

You can also try to find a study group with others at the new place so that you get additional exposure. Use good study techniques and never - never fall behind. Start early on assignments. Ask a lot of questions. I was once thought to be very smart because I asked a lot of questions in class. But in reality I just wanted answers that weren't apparent to me.  You might also try as much as possible to limit outside interests until you find your way in a new environment. However, agreeing with a comment by user aeismail, that doesn't mean to give up everything for academics. Spend several hours each week on something that contributes to your health, reduces stress, and engages your mind in a different way. I now use Taichi which does all of these things. As an undergraduate I practiced Judo several hours a week. I didn't get very good at it, but it was a great complement to studying. As a grad student I rode a bicycle with a local club - fast but not competitive. That was physically satisfying, but didn't have a mental element like Taichi does. But don't occupy yourself with trivia.  But yes, studying great books in advance ain't gonna hurt you any. I studied out of Rudin over 50 years ago and still have the book(s).  You might also find that some courses are more challenging than others Analysis v Algebra for example. That is natural as the core thinking processes and insights are just different enough that you can groove on some things and find others a bit more work. Put your best efforts where they do the most good.  Talk to your professors. Ask questions. Listen. Ask more questions. Correlation only matters for groups. You are who you are.  * * *  Why you ask questions:  Here is a story (real occurrence) from the University of Kansas about 50 or so years ago. A prof, quite well known and respected, was lecturing in Topology. This meant writing proofs on the board. Occasionally a step wouldn't be filled in with the statement \"Of course it follows, trivially, that ...\". On one such statement, a student didn't see the obvious connection and so asked. The prof looked at the board and the developing proof for a few minutes. Then walked over to the corner of the (chalk) board and started making notes to himself in a tiny script. He went into totally abstract thinking mode, ignoring the class. After a bit of writing and erasing, etc, he wandered out of the room toward his office. The students followed along, gathering outside the office. The prof started pulling books off of his shelf and consulting them - several books - several more minutes.  Then he seemed to find enlightenment and returned to the classroom. When everyone was again seated he announced. \"Yes, of course. It's trivial.\"  "

I failed this course as I was unprepared for the necessary work and discipline needed to succeed. This was a wake up call that got me into gear, thankfully.  What I have found though, as I went through my graduate studies was that often, everyone in the program is good at math and is smart. Some are a bit quicker than others, but everyone is generally pretty bright. For the most part, the successful graduate students are the ones with the work effort and the grit.  If your read any of Julian Stanley's (and now Lubinski's and Benbow's) work out of Johns Hopkins on mathematical precociousness you will see that even the most brilliant mathematical minds can fail. Talent gives you a leg up on your competition, but being willing to work hard gets you across the finish line. And then being dedicated to your craft gets you ahead of your peers.  My point is, if you are willing to work, and put in the effort to maximize your abilities, you are already on the right track to being a successful graduate student and scholar in mathematics.  Also, one last bit of advice: If in class, you are not able to follow at first, you are unlikely the only one. Math is hard and complex and requires work to get good at. One of my favorite quotes is \"...in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them.\" ~Von Neumann (i.e., math is hard and requires work).  "

      "question_body": "  I was part of a university project team, and at the end of the semester we decided to submit a review paper related to the topic of our project. Our advisers gave us feedback and made suggestions on our draft. We submitted our draft to a journal and many months later, one of my team members got a notification that our paper needed to be edited to respond to reviewer comments and resubmitted. However, he did not contact us until a few months later, when he said he thought we should not submit because the necessary edits were too demanding. However, when he went to talk to our advisers, some of them decided to continue working and resubmit. The other student did not let any of the other team members know, and told the adviser no one wanted to help him without consulting us.   A month later, we were all notified that they were resubmitting that week and they needed our consent to remove us as co-authors. They have made very significant additions to our paper, adding more sources and detail to our claims and rewording the majority of it. However, the overall idea of the paper is quite similar and there are aspects of the paper that resemble portions we wrote. I feel it is quite ungenerous of them to cut us all out from being co-authors, when we wrote the majority of the initial submission, even if the final draft is quite different. Did they do the right thing?   EDITS   To clarify some points - The main issue is that they have to resubmit in a few days, so any changes in authorship need to be approved by everyone very soon. I agree that our adviser should be changed to first author, but there's no time to get everyone's consent for that, unless he can get an extension.   The adviser has not been hostile in any way and I don't want to make things too awkward, but I don't quite feel comfortable signing off on cutting us all out. I guess my real question is should I insist they include us? How much of the initial draft must be modified before you can just remove co-authors.  ",

      "question_body": "  The situation maybe a little bit unusual, and I am asking for your opinion.  I have taught an undergraduate course on differential geometry of curves and surfaces last Fall semester. One of the students in my class, whom I think is really bright, told me that he found the proof of a certain well known theorem is a little bit hard to understand. We had some discussion on it, but I was quite busy so I wasn't paying too much attention on it, so we didn't get any good conclusion.  Recently I was revising my lecture notes and I was reminded of his question. Then he and I found that no fewer than three books (two textbooks and a research monograph) give wrong proofs of that theorem. We are quite satisfied with what we found, and his question was settled. Then he asked whether we should write a paper on this issue and submit it to some undergraduate research journal, like _Involve_. At first I didn't think it was a good idea because finding a mistake of a proof of a theorem in three books isn't really a big deal, and I told him we could send an email to the authors of those books about the mistakes. But then I think his idea might not be as bad as it seems to be because, essentially, when an undergrad can find some mistakes in well-known textbooks that (it seems to me that) nobody can find, it means something to me. My concern is I don't know even if we are talking about an undergraduate research journal, do the editors think it's certainly not worth a try or the opposite?  On the math side of that theorem, those three books use the same techniques but with different assumptions (or you may want to call simplifications). However, the proof in each of those books have different mathematical mistakes (i.e., not just some simple typos). So far we only found one textbook which gives a correct proof. The other books which contain a correct proof of this theorem are either too sketchy/wordy or those books are research monographs.  Since I have no experience on writing a paper based on the \"discovery\" of this nature, any comment is welcome. On one hand I think it's something to an undergrad student and on the other hand, I am not sure about what the editors think.  Thank you.  ",

Pointing \"they are wrong\" with a finger is not the best behaviour, even less so if you have little credibility (i.e., you are a student). If you can produce a fail-safe proof of that theorem, then why not. I have seen some papers with titles \"A bla bli blup proof of foo biz baz theorem\".  It _might_ be that your course professor is the best person to approach first. (And I also highly recommend to do so.) It takes some experience to judge if an idea is valid and fruitful or not. Said professor might also be able to discern that you all are wrong and book authors are correct with little to no image damage to you.  * * *  _Update:_ **If** you think your discovery is fail-proof, then aim for the publication by any means (with or without) the professor.  Don't fear being an undergrad.  Kolmogorov (you'd heard this name, I am sure) had at some time a hypothesis that multiplication of two n-sized inputs in on Big-Omega of n^2, i.e. that it is impossible to multiply faster than O(n^2). He mentioned it in a seminar. He was a world-known name then already. A week later an undergrad student showed him a proof that it is possible to do so faster.  While the actual story of the publication is also quite fun and breath-taking, you can research it yourself. I'd just mention, that we all know this student by this method, the Karatsuba multiplication.  "

This seems to be a false dichotomy \u2014 usually it is not an \"either-or\" (unless you submitted to an open access journal with a mandatory Open Access fee).  It might be possible that your university does not cover the Open Access fees of this journal. However, that doesn't mean you as authors _have to_ or should pay. Many universities subscribe to journals in order to make sure their researchers and students have access to papers which are _not Open Access_.

There are, commonly, a couple different mechanisms that are used to cover OA fees:    1. Lab resources. Many labs, including my own, budget for some OA publication fees in grants, startup packages, intentions for unallocated funding, etc. This would be my first stop in your case - ask your professor.   2. University resources. Sometimes the university has a pool of money set aside to pay OA fees where lab support is unavailable - usually for student projects and the like. This is often but not always done through the library, and is typically something you have to apply for (though the application might be fairly easy) and is not guaranteed   3. University-Publisher partnerships. There are some journals that allow universities to pay a chunk of money and then have their researchers get either free or much reduced publication in a journal or bundle of journals.   4. Waivers. If you _genuinely_ don't have any other funding sources, you can ask the journal to waive the publication fees for an unfunded project. But generally, this needs to be genuinely unfunded, and not just \"I forgot to budget for this\".  Which one of these - or others - that are available to you will vary based on your particular institution.  "

First, at nearly every (but not every...) U.S. university, the purely undergrad curriculum is a bit lightweight for people wanting to go to a serious graduate program.

There is no enforcing authority, etc. But, at least, such things explicitly aim to address mathematics for future mathematicians, as opposed to just having some course- of-study for U.S. bachelor's-degree requirements. (Whose breadth is generally a good thing, but whose \"major area\" requirements are very thin by world-wide standards.)  So, no, taking grad courses at X versus Y are not automatically equivalent.

Many people work in two different labs but in most situations the research is related to one another (i.e. computational and a medical research that uses the computations). Often times, even in these situations, people doing this end up choosing 1 lab or the other after a year or 2. Having 2 different labs doing different research will be a major strain on your time, so make sure you're willing to put in that kind of work. Most of these kinds of labs require 8+ hours a day when you are in graduate school, and while in undergrad between 3-5 hours a day. This is for each lab so expect 6-10 hour a day of work plus whatever classes you are taking. so having 2 might become overwhelming. I can see if you are taking easier classes you might be able to get away with it but most degrees get more difficult and time consuming as you progress so I assume that's unlikely.

For most research, this isn't the case. Particularly good undergraduate projects are pieces of a larger whole, and generally are accomplishable over the course of a summer. Testing a particular hypothesis. Working on the implementation of the algorithm on a new platform/language, etc. Applying existing tools to new data or areas as a proof of concept. Testing the sensitivity of the results of a tool to some of the parameters used for it.  Undergraduate research, to be \"successful\", should produce a project the undergraduate can take ownership of (i.e. not just \"Write the code one of my postdocs can't be bothered to) and helps move the lab's research agenda forward, but it's not necessarily _supposed_ to produce flashy standalone results or major breakthroughs.

      "question_body": "  I am currently a sophomore engineering _international student_ at a relatively well-regarded university in Asia. I am planning to do an undergraduate research with a professor whose research area aligns with my interest. However, I was having quite a hard time deciding which research group I might go about. The following is my thought, in sequential order, after thinking about many factors:    1. So I noticed that a lot of EE research groups _I'm interested in_ (most are in traditional EE fields) have no international students in the lab. Even some lab websites do not have an English page, and for other labs, I'm afraid the environment wouldn't be friendly and that I wouldn't be learning a lot. (Yes, I've surveyed some of those labs. And I also agree that we should be able to conduct the research independently, but learning from professor and colleagues is one thing to consider.) So the **final goal** would be to study Master degree at other university, not here.    2. The best plan now would be to graduate from here and apply Master degree somewhere else, probably in Europe/U.S. where the environment is more international. But I'm aware that my record is not outstanding to get accepted by a well-regarded (or maybe second tier) university in Europe/U.S., as I have two B+'s and one B0 in EE courses, quite a few B's in humanity courses (we are required to take ~8), and the rest are mixed of A's.    3. So this means that I have to do something to compensate for my bad-looking transcript, and I would go about doing research.    4. As most EE labs I'm interested in have no international students, I try to look for other EE labs that I'm less interested (or even neutral), but have internationals and more-supportive professors. Usually these are fields in modern EE, data analytics, robotics, and machine learning, and professors tend to completed his degree from top universities from U.S., and was told to be supportive to international students.    5. In short term, if I choose this modern EE field, I might be able to do research in a supportive environment and _might_ finally get a good letter of recommendation to apply for Master degree at a university in U.S. This is not the field that I was aiming at first, it is just a way that I might escape, knowing that if I were to continue Master degree here, in the field that I'm originally interested, I would be suffering through a bad time. In long term, I'm not sure for this path, as machine learning, data analytics and robotics haven't been my interest in the past. Just it is a field that a lot of EE students are now moving into and there are supportive professors.    6. So I'm in the midst of choosing research area, weighting between the field that I'm interested but no international community and kind of inactive (I could be wrong) at my current university, and the field that I have less (or neutral) interest but has more international community and supportive professors which may finally give me a chance to pursue Master degree somewhere else.  **Summary** : How would one go about choosing research lab (as an _international student_ ) at a current university, if there is a conflict between your interest and other factors? The field you are interested in but lack of supportive environment, such as no international students in the lab or not very welcome, and the field that you are less interested but has more supportive environment for international students? What other factors would you consider?  ",

So don't worry too much about picking for the long-term.  If you are a strong self-directed student who doesn't really need an advisor anyway, you could pick solely for the topic. I have known people like this, they knew what they wanted to work on exactly, so they picked a random topically proximal prof as a signature-generating machine and then they shut themselves up at home or went on an extended holiday, showing up with a completed project and thesis at the end.  But as it sounds from your description you care quite a lot about having a supportive environment and interacting with others in your group. As someone who is also more of that type, picking primarily for a good relationship with the advisor was a more successful strategy for me. Of course, you should at least be somewhat competent in the area and not completely disinterested in the topic either.  "

      "question_body": "  ## Setting  I am currently an undergraduate student in chemistry and I have recently started working on an undergraduate research project in a known laboratory in the US. I am very passionate about the topic, however I have problems with my supervisor, who is a PhD student.  ## Problem description  When I came to the lab asking for a topic to work on, the Professor assigned me to one of their students, which appears to be common practice, so I did not question this. However, I found out later that my supervisor (the student) was the only person in the lab working on the topic, and that she herself had only started working on it not long ago. After several days in the lab, my supervisor has not revealed what the eventual goal of my project will be, and from the way she behaves (stressed out, impatient towards me asking questions, which is an additional problem), I suspect that she might not know herself (quote: \"we'll figure out along the way\"). This is severely frustrating. I am aware that research is an open-ended endeavour that might be changed as new situations arise, but I thought that undergraduate research should be something self-contained, with a clear goal and time-frame, and usually well- thought out by an experienced researcher? I am aware that one possibility to resolve these issues could be to simply _talk_ to my supervisor. However, there appear to be some barriers, which leads me to my question.  ## Question  How can I approach the situation without ruining my standing in the laboratory and appearing like a complicated student, even though I am not? I would love to continue on this or a similar topic in this lab, but the current situation is very unpleasant for me.  I feel like I cannot talk to my supervisor directly as she seems impatient and stressed out, and at the same time inexperienced with supervising undergraduate students. I fear that this could make the experience even worse, with my supervisor getting angry at my criticism.  The other option I can conceive of would be to talk to my supervisor's supervisor, and ask for some kind of intervention from above. But this could also backfire in many ways, possibly making me look complicated and unwanted in the lab altogether.  ",

Mostly because, in general, undergrads require a lot of \"hand-holding\" and training (proper research procedure and writing are not usually covered before that), which takes time (even worse if it is a _good_ student that challenges you.... rewarding, but takes even more time).  You are right in thinking that undergrad research should be simple, self- contained, and well planned out. Properly planning stuff takes time, professors never have it. And simple means that the research is unlikely to have high impact.  I know several professors that don't accept undergrads simply because they think it is not worth the effort. The ones that do accept, pin them to a Ph.D. student (or a postdoc) and that's it. The Ph.D. students usually are busy, worried about their own things, and do not have the experience to deal with \"underlings\".  Yes, your project should be well defined, with clear goals and schedule. That never happens. Not as an undergrad, MS, Ph.D., postdoc, or professor. There might be a few unicorns around, but, usually, you have no idea where you are going. Ideally, you could use this opportunity to train the most important trait in a researcher: _independence_.  Instead of expecting to be handed goals and schedule, create them. It will be challenging for you, but you would learn how to do it, and get familiar with the field. Then you could go to the Ph.D. student and ask \"Do you think this is a reasonable plan?\" instead of \"what should I do?\". Worst case scenario, that plan can be a starting point for a better one. Bonus points if you include solutions to tangential problems of her research (stuff that would be cool/easy to do, but isn't a priority, so she would never do it herself).  Quoting a far better man, and professor, than myself:  > \"Be honest, be kind, **be useful** , be responsible, work hard, treat > everybody with respect.\"  I'd advise you to go around the Ph.D. student only as last resort.

So, I cited a couple of these papers, out of very very many possibilities. They weren't particularly relevant to the paper at hand, but I couldn't think of anything better. (I actually thought of posting here, but wasn't sure what specific suggestions a non-specialist could give, and I'd already tried asking specialists with no useful result.) Additionally, I used some quasi-mathematical derivations which I also had a cite for. So, generally these things do pile up.  So, I suggest backing up a step, considering the more general problem which you are trying to solve, and perhaps give some references to papers that have worked on that more general problem. Then you could say these papers are examples of the more general/related problem.  Other people have, I think, adequately addressed the issue that not being able to find relevant papers to cite means there might be a problem with the project. I.e. it is something nobody has worked on because nobody cares about the problem. This isn't necessarily the case, but I agree that you should look into that as a possible issue.  Doing novel work isn't necessarily a bad thing. I was offered a chapter in a book for a paper just published, not because the work was particularly good, but because, as the editor put it, \"not much work has been done in that area\". And apparently he thought the area was worth representing in the book.  "

If you are working on a specific problem, for example, you should reference other papers which also work on the problem. If you are using a specific tool, you want to reference some other papers that have used that tool, and certainly the result for which the tool was developed.

For example, I could very well write a paper on the derivation of the drag of a [Batman Curve](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BatmanCurve.html)-shaped object. This uses basic principles and doesn't need to call upon advanced prior results. But it's not too useful, and is probably not considered a worthy topic for research.

        "answer_body": "  Let me add my two cents in there: the main point of the references is to **give context** to your work (as suggested by multiple answers already). It's also about **justifying the validity of techniques you used** and **justifying the evaluation process** you used for your results.  There's several \"different\" references you usually want to include in your paper (and while I do admit that sometimes you don't have many in some of the \"reference groups\", I think it's impossible to have none at all):    * **general references about your (sub)field**  This would be used in the introduction, to set a broader context for the paper, especially if you're submitting to a general conference in your field instead of a small subfield-focused conference.  As an example, I work in _Mathematical Morphology_ , which is often used to perform _image segmentation, object detection_ and _image filtering_ , and belongs to the field of _computer vision_ and/or _image processing_. So, when I submit to an CV or IP conference, I have to put it in the context because **not all the referees/attendees** will be experts in Mathematical Morphology and some general references will be useful here.    * **general references about your problem**  This is actually very similar to the previous, and would be put in the introduction as well. It stems from the same reasoning: not everybody will know that _what you are attempting to solve is even a problem_.  Again a personal example: in my field of Mathematical Morphology, there are hierarchical structures used to hold information about an image _in a tree structure_. I recently published a paper about _reducing the size of those trees_. Why should anybody care? Unless I **give good motivation** , nobody will. I had to give references to various _applications_ of the tree structures I was working on (including a tiny bit of motivation for using them at all in the first place), and then give references and elaborate _why the size is an important factor_ and _what applications will benefit from my proposed technique_.  Oh, and the \"core\" of the paper was using something I used in advanced high- school programming papers: DFS. I still had to give context as to why my specific application was interesting.    * **references about the structures/techniques you used** (even if they're simple or not common for your field)  I guess this would go somewhere between Introduction and Related work. But, it's important to justify the validity of what you're using, and you're not going to prove it from scratch in your paper. Maybe it's also interesting to _ elaborate on the connections and similarities_ between the _standard usage of the technique_ and _common usage_.  I'll give two examples here: There was a recent paper in my field presenting powerful but simple techniques based on Kruskal's minimum spanning tree algorithm. Of course Kruskal was cited (even if most computer scientists learn about that in their high-school mathematics / undergrad algorithms courses). Also, there was an older paper in Computer Vision about image-by-image search applying techniques from text processing. It was explained in quite some detail how parallels can be drawn while processing an image as a text document, e.g. what is the equivalent of \"words\" in an image.    * **specific references about your problem and possible previous solutions**  Who attempted to solve it before? Maybe somebody attempted to solve a partial problem? A similar problem? The same problem in a different context? Who was the first one to pose it as a problem? This would go to Related work.  Even if your contribution is not directly based on any of those, you have to **put your solution in to context**. If there's a previous partial solution that's justification that your contribution is important. If there's a similar problem solved, comparing similarities and differences might help somebody to one day make a generalized solution. Maybe somebody got results that are as good (as fast, as complex, as precise...) as yours using different techniques? Good, compare pros and cons!    * **references about the testing framework/techniques you used**  How did you evaluate your approach? How will you justify your evaluation to the reviewers? Why are the statistics you presented actually relevant to evaluate the validity/impact of your contribution? Discussion/Results section.  For a lot of things you can produce a lot of useless statistics. You have to justify your choice of how to present your results. Is the testing framework widely used? Cite it! Is it new or an upgrade on an existing framework? Cite pros and cons related to the \"standard testing approach\" and argue why your approach is better suited to represent the pros of your contribution.    * **references about the data you used**  Similarly for the testing framework. Why this particular dataset? When did it first appear? What makes it suited for your problem? Where was it used before, and how does that justify your choice?    * **references supporting your claims about the importance of your contribution**  In addition to giving motivation, you should once more emphasize **the impact** your paper will make, and **the potential applications** of your contribution.  This is definitely different from \"what you based your paper on\". It's almost the opposite: you're listing papers/authors that might benefit from your work and base their future, extended work on your paper.  See, it's not just about citing the mathematical/algorithmic bases of your work. It's about proving that you did your proper background research, giving motivation for your problem, explaining the benefits, and convincing everybody that your work is _unique_ , _awesome_ and _useful_. And, sorry to say, if your supervisors couldn't tell you most of this, you should think about changing them (especially if you have an interest in academia).  "

      "question_body": "  My question is whether anyone has advice for dealing with difficult students. Specifically, if a student is taking up your time/mental energy and you can no longer justify this investment, how do you distance yourself while still remaining supportive?  Apologies in advance for the length of this question.  I am a PhD student currently supervising an undergraduate student completing a short lab project as part of their bachelors degree in a lab where the main supervisor has been unavoidably absent recently. In addition to this we are a small lab with broad research interests, as such I am currently the only lab member apart from my supervisor who is qualified to oversee the project designed for the student.  I have found the undergraduate student very difficult to work with, a fact I brought up with my supervisor quite early on. My supervisor asked me at that time if I would be willing to continue with the student. I was optimistic and believed that I could reason with the student about their difficult behaviour but that now seems to be off the table.  Their behaviour is surprising to me and I have a difficult time resolving it as it seems quite bizarre. I have had several 'talks' with the student now regarding their behaviour which includes a range of single incidences that caused problems in the lab. Additionally the student does not handle unforeseen situations very well and so, I have been supervising them closely at times, which costs me time and has resulted in me working later and on weekends. Finally, the student has, despite assurances to the contrary, made it clear by their actions that their priorities lie elsewhere. This final point is perhaps the one I find most bizarre as this project is 4 months out of a 4 year degree but will affect the final grade significantly.  I feel that I have been open and honest with the student, I have given them a chance to address behaviours which may not be suitable (I had assumed that they may not understand that they were now in a place of work, not a teaching lab). I have also informed the student that if they feel I am being too cold or they need a break from work to let me know - as the student often seems to become quite visibly stressed - and I could try to accommodate this. Overall I don't feel there is anything more I can do.  I have recently been informed that they have messaged my supervisor implying that my apparent 'harsh' behaviour is the reason for their lack of progress. This doesn't worry me as I have a good relationship with my supervisor and have supervised students before without issue - though never as closely as this.  At this point I feel I should cease close supervision of the student and my supervisor agrees. However, I worry that left alone the student will not be able to deliver a good project and will attempt to justify this - citing for example a 'sudden' lack of supervision. I am also reluctant to leave the student alone to perform large experiments required to finish the project as they have previously shown themselves to react quite badly in stressful situations.  In summary I feel between a rock and a hard place, do I continue to guide the student and possibly suffer the 'consequences' of their apparent belief that their slow progress is a result of my supervision and not their lack of commitment. Or do I leave the student to their own devices and risk them failing - a very real possibility from what I have observed and something I wish to avoid as it is a good project and I want the student to do well.

One of them turned out to have some short-term funding and paid for me to work with the group for a year as long as I did two days a week of general group jobs.

Backing out on what you describe as a \"promise\" would be bad form in general. If the promise was also part of why the prof currently has you in his lab (investment in training you, with the hope that you will train yourself further), then the promise has even more importance.  **What might be the effect on you?** So, this might end your job in the lab, if the coursework is a necessary co-requisite. You might find it hard to get the professor's recommendation for graduate school, if you choose to pursue it. (And/or the professor would have a harder time making a convincing case for your interest and skill in the field.)  **Red flag check** Is the professor prone to expressing anger? Did the professor force you to make a promise about this?

Study their syllabi and see if any skills meaningfully relate to the skills you would get in the recommended classes.   2. Look up on job sites what some of the marketable applications of the recommended classes are   3. Talk with other students in the lab or seniors in the major about the value of the skills from those classes.   4. Consider options you're willing to accept (e.g. not working in lab and taking desired classes; taking one recommended class and one new class; taking just the recommended classes and honing your lab skills).   5. Decide whether to bring the dilemma to the professor (if you trust him and your mind is truly not made up, and if his reaction to the different paths will impact your decision--e.g. whether or not you can keep your job in lab).   6. Otherwise, if you decide not to take the classes you promised to, tell the professor as soon as your decision is firm, so he has as many options as possible.   "

Do REU sites get any kind of credit from the NSF for accepting underserved demographics? Is this credit meaningful?  1b) If it is meaningful, is it appropriate to point out that a student falls into an under-represented category? I know that there is a great amount of sensitivity to certain demographics questions, as well as a strong preference for self reporting. Also, if this is something that REUs tend to ask in their application process I don't want to reiterate something obvious.  2a) My current institution does some undergraduate research but does not have masters or PhD students. Thus, an REU experience is especially beneficial to our students who have not been exposed to the larger academic research enterprise (particularly if they're considering grad school). As previously, do REU sites get any credit for accepting this kind of student (possibly under the theory of promoting research infrastructure)?  2b) If this is meaningful, is it appropriate to mention? I'm concerned that doing so might raise a great big red flag pointing out that this applicant is a total novice.  3) Lastly, should I mention that this student has said they're seriously considering graduate school? I would think this would be a clear positive statement for the recommendation, since (if the student turns out good) the REU institution will have a good shot at recruiting them. But, I've never been on the admissions end of this process.  All these questions are in the context of a good student who I can write an otherwise strong recommendation for, and are certainly not the basis for a recommendation.

As for your idea, it's definitely a good idea to run it by your professor before investing much more effort, as he is in a better position to judge whether it's feasible, whether it's been done before, etc.  "

It is extremely important to maintain notational consistency within your own paper; never double-up on notation or give inconsistent notation within your paper. As to where your notation should come from, as a general principle, you should **use whatever notation is easiest for the reader** , whether this is taken from another paper, or your own adaptation or invention.  Bear in mind that established fields tend to have notational conventions that people are used to, so if there are symbols commonly used for particular objects, it is generally best to use these unless there is a good reason to the contrary. When notational conventions from multiple fields conflict (e.g., you are doing a paper on random matrices, and the capitalisation conventions for probability conflict with the capitalisation conventions for linear algebra) you will need to make judgments as to what is easiest for the reader.  > If I were to conform to one notation, does the more recent source take > priority when choosing notation or the earlier source? Additionally how > would it be formatted when quoting the source with the altered notation?  There is no temporal priority rule for notation, but bear in mind that if a new notation is sufficiently well-established, it may constitute the current notational convention (check multiple papers for this, not just one newer one). When quoting a result from another paper, in your own altered notation, you should add some parenthetic remark to make the reader aware of the change:  **Example:** Wilbur (2009) notes that \"...if A and B are engaged in exclusive contractual negotiations, and C interferes with this process, causing economic harm to B, then C could be liable for tortious interference\" (p. 85, notation altered).

However, while this may be true of the _specific issue_ you are investigating, it would be _extremely_ unusual for that issue to be so unique that it cannot be put into any broader scholarly context in any field of academic inquiry.  For example, suppose you take some extremely specific topic -- e.g., you want to investigate the effect of fluctuating prices of bananas on the eating habits of rural families in Peru. Perhaps there is not yet any academic literature on that topic, but there might be news articles from time to time that talk about farmers when banana prices go up or down. Even so, if you were writing about that topic, you would probably discuss the specifics within a broader academic context with some economic theory, social science, etc. So you might augment your discussion of the specific topic by noting that shortages of bananas in other parts of the world cause consumer prices to increase, and this increases profits to banana growers, which gives them more disposable income, etc. There would be plenty of general academic literature (e.g., general economics literature) on those phenomena that are not specific to banana-growing in Peru. By citing literature on these general phenomena you would augment your specific topic by placing it in a broader context.  If you are unable to find any scholarly literature that could put your issue into an academic context, you are implicitly telling your reader that your issue falls outside the scope of all historic scientific and academic inquiry, and there is no avenue of academic research that could shed any light on your topic.

This can be of course expanded into hundreds of pages, but being to detailed is not the point here.  * * *    * People finish high school at the age of 19.   * Regarding academic education - studies - nowadays the [**Bologna Process**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bologna_Process) is applied in **most European countries**.

[Licentiate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Licentiate_\\(degree\\)) (not to be mistaken with [bachelor's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor%27s_degree)) - lasting 3 years (mostly attainable at universities), or [engineer's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_degree) \\- usually lasting 3.5 years (attainable mostly at [technical universities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institute_of_technology)). One studies a particular field from the very beginning - e.g., when studying physics, one does not have courses in biology (well, in general, as there is also biophysics, which obviously joins both) and _vice versa_ , etc. It's common that this level ends with a preparation of a small thesis (under an advisor's supervision) - usually something between 10-20 pages - some might call it simply a student project. In most cases a few weeks of research is enough for completion.      2. [Magister](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magister_degree) \\- in many aspects equivalent to [master's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%27s_degree) \\- lasting two years, being a bit more specialized - for example having a licentiate in physics, one can pursue a magister degree in astrophysics, or condensed matter, atomic physics, particle physics etc. Theoretically, one should spend most of the two years doing research for their master's thesis, but usually people choose a particular topic halfway through, and start research during their second year. Especially that there are still several courses to complete; usually more during the first rather than the second year.      3. [Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_\\(title\\)) or [PhD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor_of_Philosophy) \\- lasting four years. During the first one or two years there are some courses, sometimes taught by visiting professors, or senior faculty members. These are usually about the field of expertise of the lecturer - and these can change from year to year if the lecturer changes, e.g. once it can be about accretion disks on black holes, but the next year will have a course on relativistic magnetohydrodynamics. Usually, but not always, there's a seminar that has to be attended throughout the whole studies, or some other minor courses that need to be completed. However, usually there's only one course per semester, and rest of the time is spent on research.    * To sum up:      1. One mostly learns;     2. one learns a lot and starts to do research based on that knowledge;     3. one learns a bit, and does a lot of research.  "

Depending on how unhappy you are with this different point of view, you can either (1) suck it up and work on the problem your advisor gave you for a while (keeping an eye out for possible applications) or (2) find another advisor. Asking your advisor for a different problem is a possibility, but given that you've already asked about applications and gotten an unsatisfactory answer, this may not work.  Second, you're concerned that the research problem is too hard: \"developing a proof of convergence is rather hard and I feel uncomfortable about it, because I am on my own with the problem\". (This is _mostly_ a separate question: a problem's intrinsic difficulty is unrelated to its topic, although solving it can be more difficult if you're not motivated.) **If** your advisor is effective, then they will have given you a problem that is within your capability - even if it initially seems too difficult. Depending on your relationship with your advisor, you might be able to ask for starting points and/or reassurance. You might even be able to ask for an easier problem; getting a simpler problem in the same area seems more reasonable than getting a problem outside your supervisor's scope (i.e., an applied problem).  It's a personal decision as to whether you buckle down and work on a problem even if you're not sure you like it and can do it, but my advice - especially if you're just starting - would be to make a sincere effort before changing course. Your advisor is much more likely to give you help, or let you change problems, if you demonstrate that you've really tried to solve the one they gave you.  "

I have already done some research, but it has not been very formal, and I have not been able to devote a lot of time to it due to college coursework.  In my final year of college, my university allows me to pursue my undergrad thesis at any university / research institute where I can find a professor willing to advise me. I have been able to find such a professor in Germany, who is willing to advise me for 8 months, and his group is very relevant to the kind of research I want to pursue in future.  However, the problem is that the institute is not very well known, at least in my country. But the Google Scholar profile of the professor is decent enough. The group in which I'll be working does seem to be doing good work, although the project assigned to me currently is one on which just a single researcher is working. Also, what surprised me a little was that the researcher is just a master, she doesn't even have a PhD yet. But the work being done by her seems to be good enough and state-of-the-art.  Another criterion by which people suggested I can judge the state of a project is the funding. If a project is well-funded, it probably means it is in good shape and is going somewhere. Well, I don't know about the funding of the project exactly, but they are offering me quite a large stipend which points to the fact that they are not exactly low on funding. Also, many of my friends have applied for theses abroad and have found that obtaining a funded position for an undergrad is very hard. Considering I have a well-funded position is probably a good sign then, right?  How else can I go about evaluating this opportunity? Are the things mentioned above important to factor into this decision? Any other points I should consider?  ",

And you genuinely don't need a PhD to do world- class research, even if it would be a sign you have more experience with a degree.  So, din't worry about the research assistant not having a PhD, rather think if he/she is good in his/her research area. From your question I infer that this particular PhD student is good.  # Funding  As for funding, there are two possibilities: the student assistant rates (which are typically around 8/10 Euro/hour for up to 80 hours/month) or a research/teaching assistant position. They are stacked after having/not having a Master's, the typical rates are E12 and E13. You can google the the rate in corresponding federal county (\"Bundesland\").  An easier way is to look for third-party projects at the website of the professor / his group.  * * *  _Update:_  # Rankings  There are multiple university rankings out there. Something like CHE focuses on German universities and splits up based on the major. You might want to look that school up.  # Costs of living  A German university imposes a rather small (bureaucratic) fee. It's not the tuition typical for US universities, but rather like 200-250 Euros in a _semester_ , i.e. half a year. It brings a cheaper food in mensa and a bus ticket with it. This would not put a huge dent into your finances, but you'd need to consider it.  However, the costs of renting a flat / a room in a shared flat and medical insurance can be rather high and range from 150 to 500 Euros for living and 80-250 Euro for insurance. You would find rental costs in your typical website for renting (I am actively avoiding ads here). The insurance is probably stated in university's checklist for foreign students.  "

Certainly, the methods in graduate school build on those you learn during your undergraduate, and it is necessary to be an expert on the undergraduate methods before becoming a good PhD student. Depending on the field, that may be basically enough to be competent for graduate research, or, you may have to learn entirely new ways of thinking.

Initially it was supposed to be just a class project, but on his suggestion I did some more work and went with it at a student conference and then with substantial help from his part we managed to further expand the topic and write an article which has been published on a (small) national journal.  A few months ago I took part in a problem solving contest for undergrads. Among the problems there was one which was quite interesting, basically made out of two parts. I got the highest score on the problem, but barely did any work on the second part. I tried looking in the literature and while there are many references about the general concept, nothing about the specific version presented on the contest (I should point out that there is nothing trivial about it, i.e. the solution and the implications are different from anything I found so far). This seems like a nice opportunity for a paper, and I think I could actually get it solved with some additional help. I was thinking about proposing this to the professor that was my co-author on my first paper, but I\u2019m not really sure how to approach him, as the synopsis for the first one was totally different from this case. To make matters more complicated, we got some money out of the first paper (not much and it was his initiative to apply for the prize), and I also received a scientific performance scholarship for it, and I don\u2019t want him to feel/think that I\u2019m trying to do research for the sake of money.

For some people scholarships like the one you got are the only option to earn a degree because they don't have the financial resources to go to college otherwise.

        "answer_body": "  First there are two possibilities arising from your question that are worth entertaining:    1. Your supervisor, with greater experience, sees some hidden value that you miss in the work. You acknowledge that the problem is important and such research problems are not typically solved within the context of a Masters. So perhaps your supervisor views your topic as a stepping stone towards some other result, or perhaps they view it more as exploratory and something for you to \"cut your teeth\" on.    2. You are correct and the topic is not going to (even indirectly) produce useful results and, furthermore, should not have been given to you as a Masters topic.  If (1) is even a slight possibility still, talk to your supervisor and express your concerns as strongly as you consider appropriate given your relationship. Having such concerns should be taken as you caring about your topic and the impact of your work and your supervisor should work to address them, even if only to tell you that the topic was a long shot and it is becoming clear now that the results are negative.  Aside from this, assuming your masters topic is a bit worthless and you are quite sure that (2) is more the case: what to do? **Look to the longer term.** Since you are a masters student, this is not the end of the world. If you wish to do a PhD and are accepted for the program, my advice would be to put your focus into that. Working on a masters topic you are embarrassed by is a difficult pill to swallow, and in an ideal world one you would not have to swallow. But doing PhD's is rife with such difficulties for all but a lucky few. And it is worth noting that your professor is also human and one of the hardest challenges of academia is to come up with new, worthwhile research topics; furthermore, the nature of research is such that there are no guarantees that a topic that seems initially promising will fulfil that promise.  In summary, my advice is: **Do what you need to do to complete your Masters thesis and then look to get the best start/topic/supervisor possible for your PhD.**  * * *  Regarding embarrassment about the Masters topic, again assuming the topic really is worthless, there are three things to note:    1. Anyone whose opinion has value will understand in the context of a Masters thesis that probably the topic came from the professor, not you, and will understand the difficulties you faced.    2. If you continue to do a PhD and progress further onwards into academia, in a few years time, nobody is all that likely to read about or care your Masters thesis (unless, perhaps, the results were published as a research paper).    3. The standard expected for a Masters thesis varies wildly from institution to institution, but solving an important research problem is certainly not to be _expected_. (I mention this because perhaps you have set very high standards for your thesis.)  * * *  Aside from all that, even though your Masters topic has not been great, probably you have learned at lot from pursuing it (about the problem itself, the other work done in the area, how it could be done better, how to conduct and describe research, how to avoid a similar dead-end topic in future, etc.). The main result of yours Masters is you (and what you learnt), not your Masters. Your Masters is one or two years of research; it is a gateway to potentially decades more research on the topics of your own chosing.  "

A plan of attack can be summarised in the following way:  ## 1) Be specific  Make sure your email is brief, polite and clearly outlines why you want to work in _their_ lab in particular.  I would recommend searching for a few different labs that do the specific research you're interested in, which you can find out by looking for recent publications or on the websites of the relevant institutions. Perhaps someone in your current department can recommend a lab- they may have connections, or would be willing to write you a reference letter.  ## 2) Be persistent  If you don't get a reply within a few weeks, follow up once and then let it lie. Try asking someone else.  Most importantly, don't give up- it took me nearly three months of emailing back and forth with ten different people when I was in a similar situation last year.  ## 3) Be enthusiastic  Remember professors are generally happy when someone expresses an interest in their niche field and shouldn't just dismiss you offhand.  Good luck!  "

Find a paper (preferably published as recent as possible) that especially interests you and is written (primarily) by a researchers about half-way in the hierarchy in the institution. Then try calling that researcher. You should say something along the lines of:   \"Hi I am so-and-so, a student at stage X of my degree Y. I am very interested in your research on subject Z, especially your paper A. I was wondering if you have any positions for students like me for over the summer. Can I e-mail you about this or should I e-mail someone else?\".   In my experience, almost always they will say: sent me/that person an e-mail on this e-mail address. Of course you have your e-mail ready to go, so you hit send as soon as you hang up.   This strategy has several advantages:    1. It humanizes you. An e-mail can be sent to dozens of people with fairly little effort, a call takes more commitment. Or, it at least feels like more focused. It also shows you are interested in the actual research, instead of just the name of the top professor and the institution.   2. Usually e-mails get read sporadically and e-mails from outside students get very low priority or at times forgotten. After this call the researchers knows to expect an e-mail at a specific e-mail address about this specific topic. If you are lucky the researchers gets curious and looks at it right away.    3. If there is no chance of getting a position over the summer or you need to approach a specific person to get a chance, you get to hear it right away.   Check their website first if they have any policy on it for students wanting a position like you are looking for. If they do, follow that protocol. If not, the above protocol is fair game.  If there is no published e-mail of the person you want to contact, contact the general e-mail of the institution and ask for the researcher you want to contact. You might get a secretary that ask you to mail, in that case just mail.  I expect academics to disagree with this advice. They don't want to be called by students and want to let requests like this linger in their inbox for days or weeks until they have a moment. However in my experience calling works anyway, and academics prioritize people who called over people who only mail.  "

I've been trying to look at past examples of technologies as they were emerging and how research communities, industry, civil groups, and governments react. A good example being developments in recombinant DNA leading to the Asilomar Conference, or fetal tissue stem cell therapy leading to George Bush's executive order on federal funding on the subject. However, I'm running into a few problems:  1) Research is slow because the main search engines I'm using (G-Scholar, JSTOR) bring up a bunch of irrelevant papers. Even if I use quotes, something like ( \"emerging technology\" politics ) will bring a lot of stuff I don't need. Is there something I can do to help narrow it down to papers that are more relevant for my topic, such as additional terms, or another search engine?  2) I feel like I don't know how to do this kind of research efficiently. I've never done something this complex, and I'm pressed on time, so I can't make any mistakes. At this point, I'm just putting in search terms and finding papers that seem to fit within the general area of my paper and taking notes on Evernote.

However, for me it does not sound that literature search is your main problem. It is structuring your work. It sounds odd, but whenever I come to this point, I start to write the paper or thesis or whatever your goal is.  So just start writing up any thoughts you already have, include the notes you already have with the citations to the papers you already found. This does not have to be a coherent text, just a bunch of unfinished text segments. Eventually you come to the point where you have no notes and no own thoughts left. Then you will see what is already covered by related work and where you still have to find other publications. But now you know what to search for and you can use more precise search terms! Be prepared to rewrite every sentence several times afterwards, but you get the feeling that your work is proceeding and that is a huge motivation boost.  "

I don't believe you can successfully treat such a broad topic in such a limited time. I think many of your frustrations arise directly from your topic being overly broad.  For a doctoral student taking on such a topic for a doctoral dissertation, I would recommend that rather than treating \"emerging technologies\" as a broad topic, the student pick three or four very specific technologies, trace their individual histories, and then compare them thoroughly. That would be a concrete and meaningful way to take on such a topic.  For you, I recommend that you do just one part of that: pick just one specific emerging technology and then focus on the political issues concerning that. It's up to you to decide which specific technology to pick, but I recommend one for which you can find 10 to 30 articles. (A rarer topic with fewer than 10 won't give you much to review; a very popular topic with much more than 30 articles would yield too much for you to work with in your limited time.)

This second approach makes it much easier for faculty to help you.  This second option is not coming up with a research idea yourself, but instead finding a small gap and getting the advice of staff on where the research may lie (that you could feasibly conduct).  I must stress that it is important to be realistic about what you can do; faculty will be more receptive if what you want to do is manageable (i.e., you show them you're a grounded type of person).

Furthermore, the university has been heavily pushing to be considered an R1 institution. They are giving a lot of resources (time/money) to these research-active departments. People at the teaching-intensive departments are at a significantly disadvantage since our research is less intensive, so we never get the internal grants.

It is difficult to > get internal funding when competing with people in other areas that have > more time for research. > > They: Then you can apply for external funding, we support your efforts to > get grants....  **In summary,** I work at an undergraduate department, but due to funding agencies rules, I am considered to be at a research intensive institution. Also, I have applied for grants, and colleagues at panels told me (in confidence) that other weaker proposals were funded because they got the PUI classification. My research was not considered strong enough (for a research intensive institution).  **Has anyone had this experience?**  **How can I maximize my chances to get INTERNAL funding when competing with people that have much more time for research?**  **How can I maximize my chances to get EXTERNAL funding when competing with people that have much more time for research?**  ",

        "answer_body": "  A few thoughts -  One is that extramural funding is more about gaining prestige from your institution than actually resulting in a net revenue gain to your University. See [this article from the American Association of University Professors website](https://www.aaup.org/article/crisis-extramural-funding) for an explication of the ways in which the focus on extramural funding harms universities.  That said, if your tenure and promotion system is based on securing external funding and/or having time to do research, then you probably still have to play that game even if you know that it's harmful to the university in the long run. One thing I'm thinking is psychological research about locus of control; if you believe that you are in control of your own success or failure it's been shown that you put more effort into and consequently have better performance than if you believe that others control what happens to you and that what you do doesn't matter. It does sound like the system is rigged against folks in your situation, but nonetheless, you can still do your best to put together a competitive application - have folks read over your applications, look at other people's successful applications, etc. Perhaps there's an office or staffperson on campus that helps with applications for external funding that could be a resource?  Finally, it sounds like there are some more systemic issues about courseloads and advising loads being too high. These seem like great things to raise during faculty union meetings or to bring up to your Academic Senate representatives - you're probably not the only one feeling this way, and if you can open up a conversation with other faculty maybe there are some changes that can be made in the way things work. Here's [a case study about how faculty unions dealt with this in Ohio](https://www.aaup.org/article/what- faculty-unions-can-learn-workload-policy-ohio) that might offer some inspiration for taking collective action.

In the meanwhile, you have to do the best you can with your given situation.

Making sure that it gets done should be your top priority while you're there (and possibly looking for other positions).  "

You have basically three paths here:    1. _Stop working with your advisor._ Depending on how bad it has gotten, escalating levels of this solution could be trying to get another member of your advisor's group to take over working with you so you have to see him less, to find a new advisor to continue your current work, to take a semester of mental health leave and start over on a new project afterwards, or even to drop out.    2. _Try to make your advisor behave better._ You know your advisor best and can better judge what he would be likely to respond to. Maybe if you just told him \"Please don't call me an idiot,\" he would stop. Maybe if you could get the ear of a sympathetic member of your faculty, they could take your advisor aside and tell them to be more gentle. If your university offers counseling, maybe a counselor could help you raise the subject with him and negotiate some rules for how to work together. Maybe you can raise a formal complaint somewhere (dean, ombudsman?). (The last one will probably torpedo your chances of good recommendation letters, but might let you graduate without having to take more abuse.)    3. _Tough it out._ If it's only a few more weeks, maybe deciding that you choose to take it just a little bit longer because you think that the rewards (graduation, recommendation letters) are worth it helps you get through it. This also needs a good support network. Talking things through with a therapist or counselor can help distance yourself emotionally from your advisor's comments. Let your friends console you. Seek affirmation from other places: are there any other activities where you are doing well? Classes that you are excelling at? A hobby that produces things you can be proud of?  No matter which option you ultimately choose, I encourage you to at least informally talk to a university counselor and whoever handles complaints to be aware of all your options. For each of the options, what process exists? What are the upsides/downsides? Make a list, and then make a deliberate decision. Sometimes, even just knowing that you _could_ leave and do something else but are actively choosing to stay in your current situation for now because you feel the recommendation letters are worth it makes all the difference.

Both were done during school terms, and were in my 2nd and 3rd years.  In the first assistantship, I chose to work in an area outside my field of study (and outside of my future interests), due to some interest from high school. The topic was too complicated and unfamiliar to me, however, and I was not able to make any contributions. I spent the entire term attempting to read papers on the subject (and not understanding most of them).  The second was more related to my field, and I was able to make some contributions. It was not at the quality that I would accept from myself now, however.  If a masters application form/site asks for a **complete** record of academic activities/jobs, I will be including information on these.  Would it be likely to help, or harm, and application if I included information on these **voluntarily**? I can see two possible views myself, but do not know if someone reading an application is likely to see them that way, or which would carry more weight:    * Poor performance is the major factor that will be seen in the applications   * Including these could show the ability to try and take on extra work (hopefully more successfully)  In either case, I would be able to speak about some lessons learned from the experience.

The point of undergraduate research is (1) to give you some taste of research, (2) to learn a few things, and (3) maybe help contribute a small amount of insight to some problem. At least in math, it's more common that undergrad research \"only\" results in a learning experience rather than a publishable paper. In fact, many research projects for grad students and beyond never become papers, and of those that do, it generally takes more than half a year. That's the nature of research. It's not easy.  Moreover, as you advance and mature your point of view, it's natural that you view your earlier work as naive (again, this is true for professional researchers). That's fine. That doesn't mean there was something wrong with what you did earlier, but just that your understanding has advanced.  Anyway, to answer your question, I would probably include lines on my CV saying you were a research assistant, and at least briefly touch on them in your personal statements.

I've been reading papers, trying to explain why some methods outperform others and often times I do not fully understand them. The high level logic maybe I understand, but certainly not the in-depth algorithms or implementations.  I feel as if I know nothing about this field (and I probably really don't know much).

      "question_body": "  I am burned out and exhausted and need a place to rant and get advice. =(  I am an undergraduate student majoring in Information Systems who was hired a few months ago to work in a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research lab at my university. My job consists of reviewing academic papers before submitting them for publication, conducting experiments using a variety of HCI equipment, giving lab demos to classrooms, as well as working on my own research paper that is to be submitted to an academic journal in a few months.  When one of the professors in my department asked me to take this job, I was hired to assist in the lab for 10 hours per week. About two weeks later, she increased my weekly hours to 20 because there wasn't enough time to complete everything she was giving me. I was flattered that she was happy enough with my performance to continue giving me projects to work on. Sometimes the work was very boring (performing a literature review on a topic you have no interest in is a nightmare) but I thought it would be a good experience.  As the semester went on, the professor (she's in charge of the lab) just kept giving me more and more projects. She went to HR and increased my weekly hours to 29, which is the maximum amount allowed for students at my school and it's only given in special circumstances, without even asking me if I was OK with it. However, there are many weeks where I have worked much more than this. The worst was last week, which was the week before finals, when I was in the lab 42 hours conducting experiments for her. I only got about 4 hours of sleep each night that week and could barely concentrate on my schoolwork. Since it is against HR policy to have students work more than 20 or 29 hours in one week, she told me to arrange my time sheet to make it look like I worked only 29 hours that week and then claim the additional hours later. I'm pretty sure it's illegal to do this.  While I am flattered that she is pleased with my work performance to continue giving me these projects, I feel like she is taking advantage of me. On the rare chances that I had a few hours of free time this semester, I usually used them to catch up on much-needed sleep or tried to do some sort of task that would get the research work out of my mind. It's been very difficult to enjoy myself. With winter break coming up, I thought it would be a great time to recover. However, she has already given me enough projects that will take about 30-40 hours per week throughout the break, with deadlines for each one.  I realize that the simple solution is to tell her that the work is too much and that I cannot handle everything while focusing on my classes. But at the same time, I do not want to disappoint her. She is the most prestigious professor in my department (in terms of publications, awards, experience, etc.) and is very happy with my performance. She would be an excellent reference to have and I do not want to risk harming that relationship. It's hard for me to determine if this amount of stress is worth getting a (hopefully) better job in the long run. Every company I've talked to has been very impressed by what I've been doing in the lab.  FYI, I am purposely trying to keep my job responsibilities vague to avoid revealing too much information. However, hopefully this example will give a better idea of the types of projects she gives me: In September she introduced a new research area to me (it was also new to her). She gave me 1 month to perform a comprehensive literature review and write an extended abstract to submit to an academic conference. I struggled a lot with it because she gave me no training and could not provide support due to being new to the research area as well. After submitting the abstract, she gave me many other projects to work on, and I never had a chance to work on that research again. Today the extended abstract was accepted for the conference, but the reviewers criticized it quite heavily. She told me that in the next 1-2 months I will need to come up with a research question and hypothesis, improve the literature review, create a methodology, conduct experiments to collect/analyze data, and finish writing the majority of the paper. Then, next summer, she wants me to miss out on my internship to attend the 1-week conference and give a presentation on the research. I feel like this is unrealistic for an undergraduate student. It might be a little different if she had some experience in this research area and could assist me, but she does not.  I've always wanted to go to graduate school, but if it's going to be anything like this, I'm not even going to bother applying.  Someone please tell me this is abnormal advisor behavior.  ",

The simple reason why this happens is that you are much _cheaper_ than a PhD student or a PostDoc doing the same things you are currently doing. It is evident that the supervisors need research (or whatever other project it is) to be done and want to have it done sparing as much money as possible: this translates into addressing the job to undergraduate students who demand little (if not even none at all) pay per hour. It is unfortunately common behaviour.  Especially if you are passionate about your field do not allow such attitude; it will end up draining you out and you will associate the discomfort to science, whilst instead science is what you love and the discomfort is being caused by your advisor.  As an undergraduate student your own responsibility (for yourself) is to complete your master thesis in a affordable limited amount of time: all the rest is superfluous. Only then go into research and start doing it properly: you will have a decent salary (i. e. you will be at least paid decently for all the work you put in) and everything will be fully documented.  The above said, doing research is nevertheless complicated as it asks to conciliate your personal life with (in general) a lot of pressure of strict deadlines, lack of funds, lack of time and so on and so forth. Despite so, I believe that whoever is passionate about their topics should try to pursue the academic career.  "

You have no written proof of her conversations, and because it's your neck on the line for lying about your hours, you will not get recompensated for it either in money or in time: this professor will _not_ , I repeat _not_ give you _any_ time off while you are being paid since she obviously has limited amounts of funds (or she would not be leaning on an undergrad in a haphazard manner like that) and an overallotment of work. She will not give you backpay when she has nothing more to gain from it. Particularly since she has _no_ respect whatsoever towards you as a person.  So stop being flattered _immediately._ You let yourself be maneuvered into a situation of complete exploitation and you need to stop this or you will never finish your studies.

This is your first priority. Then figure out how much time and energy that leaves you realistically to work on this professor's tasks.  Then schedule a talk with your professor. Tell her how much hours you can put in for her work since she did not bother asking. That's the number she can hire you for and that's the number you can deliver and sign for.  Be prepared that you will not get compensated for your \"overtime\" so far. Be prepared also that you might lose your \"job\" picking up everything after behind the professor on the spot and lose her goodwill. Someone as self- absorbed and egoistic as she is may well retaliate in absurd manners and pick up her next chew toy of which there seems to be no shortage. But you should be able to continue your studies in a sensible manner. Either because she accepts what you can offer, or because she declines it.  Even if she accepts, it will be your task continually to ensure you only work the times you are paid (or at least in reasonable relation to them) and to tell her \"no\" when some tasks she wants to throw at you cannot be done in the time you have available.

So far having approached, and sought out people who are very well known on campus has let me have more control over the situation. It seems it may be the other way around for you. Never in any case should you kiss butt. I'm telling you that's a one way ride to no respect land. One job is not worth your life. You literally have NO life. Your health is deteriorating. And I don't know what you program policy is, but students at my university cannot suddenly go from an A+ to a B- in one semester without their advisor asking them what's up. Your grades should be a top priority alongside your health. The work you've done so far has gotten your name out there and people will be more than willing ot work with you in the future. If your advisor truly values you, they will work with you. I work with the head of the crop and soil sciences department and he literally trusted me from day 1 to work with his colleagues on major research projects and the more I showed him I could do the work, the more he let me work on anything I asked and when I could. He never dictated my work schedule and I could work from home if need be because he respects and trusts me. This is the type of relationship you want. I realize your tasks are less independant and require a lab, but ideally you should be left alone to work at your own pace. Not hounded for more and more hours. Considering it costs probably $2 an hour to hire you (I'm assuming you use fed. funded work study), I also would errr on the side of caution that this may be the case. My boss was very upfront that if it were not for me, his side projects would never get done because he has NO time and can't afford another full time worker in his department. So hiring me is cheap, but he treats me well, and I have no issues maintaining an A+ average and having time for my partner, friends and family. Sleep is crucial for mental and emotional well being and without it, I'd probably go crazy and kill someone :P so I don't know how you're doing it. I mean I would have literally collapsed due to anxiety attacks. So take my advice and put your foot down. If they aren't concerned about your academics...they're very selfish in my opinion.

Work as a graduate student can be trying, the hours long, the remuneration poor, and the value of a successful outcome is increasingly suspect. However, that is not the problem here. You are presumably legally an adult at this point in your life and if you decide that working outlandishly long hours is acceptable then the opinion of no one else matters.

Money: it's never clear in these letters what kind of support the student wants/expects. The default assumption is that I would pay for them, and as an academic with limited resources, I have very little incentive to pay for an undergraduate to travel from India to the US to work with me, especially when it's unlikely they'll be able to do much in three months. Which brings me to    2. Project timeline: most letters of this kind are of the form \"I'm interested in BROAD TOPIC A and want to work with you because you're interested in NARROW TOPIC B\". For a three month internship to work, a project has to be very focused, and set from day 1. There's no time to explore.    3. Self-interest: There's very little gain for me here, or at least none that's mentioned in the letters. If I want to hire an undergraduate, I can do it locally. I can even get financial support (sometimes) for doing that. I can't do that with a student from abroad, and I can't even vet them in advance.   So any successful letter needs to address these three issues very effectively and quickly (because I delete these emails without reading more than a few lines).  Having said that, I know of at least one example where a student came from India to work with a colleague and that summer project turned into an application to grad school.

This was never solely my project; there were a few graduate students who would provide guidance and some help with assays. However, I unequivocally did the most work on the project. I played a major role in the writing process and created six of the seven figures. I also presented a poster of this work (on which I was listed as first author) at an international conference.  Now, as we are getting close to submitting, I have found out that my mentor plans to put one of the graduate students on the project in the first author position. He is unaware that I know this. I feel that I can say rather objectively that this student by no means deserves first authorship. In fact, he is well known for his laziness and probably doesn\u2019t even deserve second authorship. The reason this is happening is because he and my mentor are _very_ good friends outside of the lab. The student is frequently granted benefits and immunities because of this.  Please, I would appreciate any advice. I want to confront my boss but I feel this will only injure our relationship which I need intact. My mentor is by far my strongest letter of recommendation for graduate school and I need his compliance to graduate with honors from my university.  ",

        "answer_body": "  It's possible that you are misunderstanding what the signature of a department head implies or requires. In general, signatures are used to ensure that policies and procedures have been appropriately followed. Save for unfortunate cases where resources are solely allocated due to rather extreme corruption (beyond anything I've personally encountered), you don't have to have some sort of deep personal history or relationship just to take part in an existing publicly advertised academic program.  The most common way this comes up is a form that requires two signatures - one from your advisor (or other faculty member relevant to the request), and one from the head of the department. The advisor/faculty member is usually the one responsible for making sure you meet all the program requirements, and believes you should have the request indicated by the form authorized. Then the signature from the head of the department is generally just a bureaucratic formality, and the department head's job (often delegated to an assistant) is to ensure you qualify, etc (making sure the faculty member did their job correctly), maybe ask a few questions or require supporting paper work if applicable (if it's routine they won't even do that), and then sign. And off you go!  To see what is truly required to get into your school's program, you'll need to look up further information about it on the website - if one exists (it may not have useful info), and talk with whoever administers the program. You might also just go to your department office and ask the assistant for more information about the program. You can just say, \"I read about the program where you can work towards a masters while you are an undergrad - how can I find out more about this program?\"  You can then find out if the program is a competitive application process, are there certain qualifications you need before applying to the program (such as completing a certain number of courses, having a certain GPA, meeting with a graduate advisor, etc), and all the other details you might want to know about to decide if the program is right for you and how you can join. It could be as simple as ask to join, give your transcript to the assistant and they will have the chair sign, and you are in (so long as you pay the bills, which might increase to be a part of that program). But you won't know until you talk directly to the appropriate staff members - no need for scheming just yet!  "

Make some minor adjustments to this paragraph and email it to the department head! Of course, neglect the \"psychopathic a-hole\" part, but just tell the department head what you want to do. As @BrianHall pointed out, you may only need their signature for the program, but I don't see how having a professional relationship with the department head could be bad. In fact, s/he may have some important suggestions for you on how to meet your goals. If a student came to me with what you just said, I'd do anything I could to help them succeed.  Before applying for PhD programs, I emailed the department head at many universities to see if there was anyone in their department interested in my research proposal. One of these was the department head of Geography at University of Tennessee. I ended up interviewing for a different program at UT-Knoxville but decided to visit the Geography department head because I had some free time and really appreciated his response to my email. We talked for a while, and he was a genuinely nice guy. Now he's the president of our flagship professional organization, and I'm really glad I had the chance to meet him in person! Networking with professors can be beneficial in more ways than what are immediately apparent, so take a chance and go meet with him.  "

However, if there's some program or award you think you might be considered for, and the department head has some discretion about awarding it, you could **write her a letter** (not an email - a letter; and not a short note - a letter) describing your background, your achievements so far, your interests and your plans, and requesting whatever you're asking for - even if you're not nominally eligible.  * * *  As a side note,  > At my school there is a program, I have heard of, that would allow me to get > my masters as an undergraduate  I might not be in academia in the same country as you, but - this might not be a good idea.

      "question_body": "   _Note, by highly technical skills I mean anything that isn't directly taught by your course (i.e. programming/coding, use of specialist lab equipment, mathematical expertise)_  I am student of Earth Sciences/Geography within the UK.  I'm planning on doing a masters and in brainstorming ideas for my application's thesis proposal, I often run up against the issue of lacking specific technical skills needed to conduct the study. Should I let this hamper me? **I worry I'm restricting my potential by only choosing topics in which I can wholly conduct every step of the research/analysis independently.**  For example, my undergraduate dissertation required large datasets and modifying open-source software, meaning I independently taught my self to code. Another student looked at microfossils which required the use of a spectrometer.  Although both of skills were not taught to us, I independently taught my self to code while uni staff operated the spectrometer machine for my peer, meaning he didn't have to learn it.  If I want to study, say, microplastics in fish, will I need to be able know how to use the required lab equipment and interpret the results or is it acceptable to outsource this?  ## Summary  To word my question another way, **University thesis: How can you utilise highly technical skills without falling into the rut of teaching your self everything from scratch?**  **I taught my self coding for the sake of my undergraduate dissertation, at the cost of a loss of free time which could be spent on my area of study (Earth Science, not Computer Science). Coding is not the direction I want to take in life despite the effort to learn it. I, therefore, do not want to invest so heavily in another one-off skill for my masters.**  My two main concerns are:    * Restricting my potential research topics to studies which I can wholly conduct and interpret each research technique.    * Become stuck teaching my self a skill which I do not desire to follow up in the future (i.e. a statistical technique, coding, lab equip)   * Use up a lot of time independently learning said technique  ## Real life example  In the question linked [here](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/15306/how-to-speak-to- advisor-about-hiring-an-unscrupulous-student?rq=1), a SE user discusses how during his masters two programmers were hired to help with programming.

You can teach yourself, or take a class, or hire a tutor or whatever, but one way or another, you won't get very far trying to get your university, or anyone else, do the coding for you. As @JeffE and others were politely trying to help you understand, coding in the science and technology worlds today is such a basic skill that your comparison to operating specialized lab equipment simply isn't appropriate. A more proper comparison would be to things like typing up documents or using Microsoft Excel. Would you consider asking your university to get someone to help you with Excel because you can't be bothered to learn it? No? Didn't think so...

I think the key here is working out which skills you can reasonably expect to learn during the project and do a sort of cost/ benefit analysis. You need to be realistic about what is feasible. If the barrier is a particular statistical technique that you're unfamiliar with, it may be relatively easy to pick it up as you go along- you may even understand it better by using it \"in real life\".  However, if the skill is much more difficult, for example, learning to program if you've never typed a line of code in your life before, then it is probably unrealistic to plan a study using such a skill. This comes down to your judgement and your judgement alone; we don't know how easy or difficult such skills may be for you to learn.  > To word my question another way (...) how can you utilise highly technical > skills without falling into the rut of teaching your self everything from > scratch?  In my own (small) research experience, I found that learning tools on the job actually meant I learnt more, and faster than if I had taken a course on it. I learnt more about programming by teaching myself to write code in Python than I got from two years of lectures and workshops on Fortran during my undergraduate. And you know what, I also enjoyed it more! Learning is fun-- but the most valuable part was that I learnt how to teach myself skills. I started to learn how to be an independent academic. And if you want to do any kind of academic research in the future, knowing how to learn independently is important. In fact, I'd argue that's the whole point of the degree.  > Would it be reasonable to request the university for someone to help with a > skill I've not been taught (i.e. coding or high-level statistics) for my > master's thesis?  As Mad Jack says, this depends on the individual department/ university, but I think you are underestimating the help your supervisor will likely provide. If the skills or techniques are common in the field, they will help you learn them (or point you in the direction of a friendly PhD/ post doc who can).  Ultimately research is all about learning new things. You never know, the skills you learn now might seem useless, but in ten years' time may be vital to your research. I don't think you can get stuck in a rut when you have the whole world around you to learn more about.  "

If anything, I would say that it is more beneficial to have experience outside your undergraduate institution than inside, as this gives you the opportunity to meet many more potential collaborators, exposes you to new ideas and different research cultures and will hopefully give you a wider knowledge of your subject and academia in general.  However, if you're intending to continue at your current institution as a postgraduate student, then it would be wise to try and do some kind of research project (your course may require a final year dissertation, thesis, project or similar) with a current member of staff. This means you get to know them and more importantly, they get to know you and will remember your name when your application for postgraduate studies lands on their desk.  If a professor already knows you as a hardworking, reliable undergraduate from that summer project you did with them, they're much more likely to take you on in the expectation you will also be a hardworking, reliable postgraduate (in comparison to the stranger's application next to yours on their desk). Even if you don't intend to apply at the same institution for postgraduate studies, having a supervisor who can write you a strong reference is always a bonus.

PhD admissions committees will also be aware that many applicants are applying before finishing their Master's degree (if we are talking about UK PhDs here, where candidates are generally expected to have a Master's degree by the time they start- unlike the US, where someone going from Bachelors direct to a PhD is more common). This means that having a research project or thesis still in progress when you apply is not going to count against you.  > \"In the first university, and I will have done more semester projects > throughout the year, but the Masters thesis is only at the very end of the > degree, hence after PhD applications.\"  While you may be writing the thesis itself after the applications are finished, I think you will be aware of who your supervisor is going to be and what topic you will be working on well beforehand. If you choose this option, you will be able to discuss the future project in your research statement and interviews.  > \"The second option would consist of a Masters project in either the second > or third semesters (thus, either before or during applications), although > likely not in the areas I'm interested in.\"  This option doesn't sound so good to me. I made a point of finding a topic for my Master's thesis that I was very interested in, and it led almost directly to me getting a PhD place (even though I was barely halfway through the project when applying for the PhD). Admissions committees want to see motivation for your studies, and if you're not keen on your thesis topic this might be difficult to convey.  > \"...how many solid research experiences (equivalent to a Masters thesis- > level) would be needed for admissions into the top 10-20 US schools?\"  From what I have learned by participating in this site, many US PhDs don't even require _one_ Master's thesis- and I think, unless you're changing field significantly, it would be unreasonable to expect applicants to have any more than one Master's degree.  Finally, you mentioned in a comment that EPFL (I think) offer some neuroscience courses during the physics MSc. Given your goal of a neuroscience PhD, the opportunity to gain some experience in neuroscience before you apply can only be a bonus- one, because it will help you justify your motivation for applying; two, because you will be able to confirm for yourself that you really are interested in the field; and three, it may give you some ideas of topics you could focus on in your PhD.  **The bottom line**  Find a topic you are really interested in for your Master's thesis, regardless of when you will be working on it. If you know the topic beforehand you can at least read up on it and discuss preliminary aspects of the project in your PhD applications.  Admissions committees want to see research experience (which in university number 1 you will get from the semester projects) and enthusiasm/ motivation for the topic, which you can demonstrate by talking about the ongoing thesis work.

I volunteer to do this on weekdays from 10am to 7pm, and I stay late until 9pm once or twice a week to finish the day's set of images when it's considerably large.  I'm spending at least 45 hours per week drawing circles. I'm working efficiently (it takes me on average of 15 minutes per page of stitched images), I try not to take breaks to maintain momentum unless I'm noticeably slowing down (and limit them to 10 minutes), and I try not to take more than 30 minutes for lunch.  I understand that monotonous tasks are a key part of research, and it's suitable work for me as an undergraduate ([as they're low-risk and require little experience](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/66805/40887)). I'm also lucky to do research so early in my career. But in the evenings, I begin to think of all the other undergraduates out there getting ahead doing amazing work (like [Martin McLaughlin](http://news.mit.edu/2016/chemical-mystery- enzyme-cannibalizes-0808), who already produced publishable, original work in his first year), and I feel discouraged and expendable.  And it's entirely my fault, too. If I spent my time in high school more effectively by learning Python coding for automation, statistics, and understanding more of the relevant literature, I could be so much more useful to my supervisor doing more stimulating complex tasks.  It's been a month since I've started, and the long hours of this repetitive task are wearing me down. But I don't want to let my supervisor down, so I intend to keep getting the daily image set done each day. She hasn't required me to set these hours or get the image set done each day, but I've been doing this for so long that it's expected (though she's always very appreciative each time I submit, and she works longer hours than me).  I plan to continue until the project is complete when my supervisor graduates in December (lessening hours to the evenings when classes resume). Until then and for future research opportunities, **how can I keep myself motivated with monotonous tasks and avoid burning out**?  ",

You're burning yourself out by working 45 hours a week and you haven't even started university yet.  In my opinion this is a perfect opportunity to learn programming and image processing. I have worked with many undergraduate and even high school students (I was one myself) in different labs, and I can tell you that you're perfectly capable of learning basic programming skills over the next two months if you work at it. With these skills you can attempt to make software that recognizes these ROIs in your images automatically.  From the sound of it your supervisor is a graduate student and not a professor, and since you're volunteering, they should have no problem with you taking a different approach to solve the problem of identifying ROIs. If they want people to do simple repetitive work, they can use a service like Amazon Mechanical Turk.  So to answer your question, academia is all about coming up with new approaches to solve problems or learn new things. If you want to stay motivated, use this time to learn something new that will help you in the future, and also help your supervisor.  "

In flipping through materials likely to have student works, you can get an idea of what's appropriate.  If the professors are hard to approach, show them you've done your pre- research and maybe even attempted some things.

I sent him an email listing 3 different projects I had thought of, and he emailed me back saying he wouldn't do those, but he had a project I should do (climate mathematics, never even thought about it before). I was kind of taken aback, but in the end I thought, well this is the best I am getting, and took the project.  When we finally met the following year, I was still a little skeptical, but as we started working through the problems I found out how interesting the subject was. I learned a lot through his mentorship, and gave chalkboard talks on different papers / analysis results (working out of Courant/Hilbert and Wittaker) every few weeks and a few months in I was very fond of the project and was spending all of my time on it just because of how interesting it was, and the story ends with it turning into a good publication.  Turns out the professor had the idea planned out during sabbatical. He was working with a research team there where many ideas were created, and the papers I worked from were recent results by newly minted PhDs he was working with. He had even published a paper on how to teach undergraduates climate science: this man had though it through!  There are a few morals to the story. First of all, when you're young in your research career, you don't know what is interesting yet, and a quick read of the literature is not enough to gauge this. Also, if plenty of people are researching a subject, it's probably pretty interesting and worth a try. Lastly, for research with undergraduates, the good mentors would like you to go with their ideas because they have a plan for how to teach it / work through the problem.  All together, I would say find a mentor you respect and trust and just ask them to take you under their wing. It may not be the project you had in mind, but you will learn a lot more this way, and you'll be surprised how interesting the project is.  "

Most people won't be thinking about whether you're an undergrad or a postdoc; they'll just be listening to the ideas you exchange. As a graduate student myself, I love working with undergrads who are motivated and excited about research. Of course there will always be some people who think they're above you simply because they have more credentials, but that's their problem, not yours.  Asking people about their own research can be a great entry point since everyone likes to feel that what they're doing is appreciated. Check out a poster session on campus and find a few posters that you're interested in. Eventually you'll start a great conversation with someone. Be patient and don't give up!  "

        "answer_body": "  The main difference from being an invited, visiting student, an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates), and a summer research program is usually related to funding issues. [REU is what the National Science Foundation (NSF) calls it's program](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=5517&from=fund), and the funding provided usually only supports \"U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, or permanent residents of the United States\". Students who are part of the program usually get a stipend as part of the package. Some programs who are advertising an REU still accept international students, it's just that the funding for those students are not provided by the NSF - read 'terms and conditions' if there is a formal program for more details.  Being a visiting student or being in a summer research program is similar, but generally supported by institutional resources (which may just be administrative, with no funding).  However, the meat of the issue is what you get to do while you are there. If you are interested in graduate school, then ideally you would work with a professor in a group on a real research project. Ideally it could potentially lead to a publication down the road, but this is neither necessary nor guaranteed - but it's good to work with that as a long-term goal to help guide and motivate the work.  I was part of an NSF REU on the east coast as well, but based on my conversations with other students the benefits I'll mention below still can apply.  So the main advantages possible are:    * working hard and doing good work that could be the grounds for a very supportive letter of recommendation, ideally from someone who is well known (and from a well known University is good as well)   * networking, which is to say expanding your social circle and developing contacts with people with similar interests and direction (very hard to do without physical presence for an extended period of time)   * building your confidence and making you more comfortable in your statements and future work   * learning more about different aspects of the research process, which you may not have seen in this particular way before   * living in a place you've never been to before, which is not only valuable as a maturing and learning experience in its own right, but can help you decide if you might really be OK with moving to such a place for multiple years away from everything and everyone you know   * if you work hard at networking and socializing (while still doing great work), you can potentially meet a future advisor, or even just someone who will help you with your application materials, statements, give you an introduction to someone else, etc.   * it can be a great way to see behind the curtain and experience both lots of good things, and even more importantly, lots of unpleasant and bad things. Academia is no utopia, and I don't think it does anyone any good to go into a graduate program thinking there aren't all kinds of messes and complexities. This could be a chance to see more of that first hand, to help you be more realistic.   * beyond just getting into a graduate program, the networking and experience can aid you in doing well in research, knowing people at conferences, etc.  While I personally strongly encourage everyone to seek out such opportunities, it is up to you to consider the costs and decide what is right for you. On the downside:    * it is often expensive. Even though I was funded quite reasonably, I would have had lower expenses and had higher income if I had stayed home and worked for the summer.   * it can be hard emotionally. You are in a new place with people you don't know, away from family, friends, food you are used to eating, the comforts of home, and more. It can be so great to meet new people and form new friendships, but that doesn't erase the hard parts.   * it is very time-limited, which means everything is compressed. It's enough time to start to get comfortable before you have to leave, while also being long-enough to develop homesickness.   * you are a short-timer, and just because you are there does not mean you are automatically an insider or in-group member. Some people will be accommodating and friendly, and other people may ignore you because they know you will be gone soon anyway. Some people will take time out to meet with you and give you advice, some won't give you the time of day.    * there is no guarantee of anything. You may find people you thought you would work with become unavailable, the project disappears (one person I know at a different place found the 'project' was unavailable, and they ended up having to make their own project by talking another faculty member into letting them work on their stuff instead).    * if you are doing things in the academic off-season (like summer in the US), many people will be gone regularly, lots of vacation and conferences, most students won't be around, many food places on campus might be closed, etc. It's just different.  I'm very glad I chose to do a summer REU, and things worked out nicely for me - I'm very happy with the results. I can't tell you the future of how things would go for you - but if you are excited (if not nervous) for the potential positives, willing to work hard and get way outside of your normal comfort zone, and are ok with the potential negatives and willing to roll with whatever difficulties you find, I think you would be a great candidate. Budget out the costs and make sure this expense won't prevent you from having the funds to apply to grad school (it's expensive, especially in the US), travel for potential campus visits if you get accepted, have your own personal living security, etc.  Whatever you choose, good luck!

The other meaning is that they did not use the source, but just wanted to add to the bibliography. Personally, I would view this as academic dishonesty, because the student misused references to fraudulently meet requirements of the assignment. I don't know if your professor or others would view that the same way, but that's how I typically view it.  Another scenario is that a student puts a citation in-text and in the reference page, but the material cited has nothing to do with that reference. This would be more difficult to catch, unless the professor is an expert in the area the student is writing about, but this would be considered academic dishonesty, too.  If you have additional sources available that are relevant to the topic, it seems that finding material from the source to include somewhere in your paper and editing the paper would be easy and resolve the problem anyway, so why not just incorporate something (a sentence or two, even) into your paper?

I'm in a unique situation, and I'm wondering whether I should leave tenth grade early this year to accept a research position for four months at a leading university.  I am a deep thinker and am profoundly miserable because my present educational environment isn't intellectually stimulating, growth oriented, and I'm worried I'm not accessing my potential. Because of this, I'm going to be leaving high school next year and hoping to attend the visiting students program at a nearby college. I don't think not being in traditional high school will be a hindrance to my college admissions; on the contrary I think what I do outside of school will boost my candidacy.  I've recently been offered a research-internship position at a lab at: Cornell, Princeton, Oxford, and Rockefeller.

Get most of this clear up front if you are likely to return.  Next, this scenario offers you an opportunity. It is not too dissimilar to the 'semester schools', where HS students go as a 'semester abroad' kind of arrangement - often the credits there map back on to standard HS courses. In addition, it can give you an excellent essay topic or two for college applications.  Now, if you have no intention of returning to your HS, things get slightly harder perhaps. That means either a GED (probably easy) and college applications, or a university that accepts early leavers - Simon's Rock is one, U Delaware used to at least, as did New Mexico Tech. In these cases, there can be issues (one person I knew well went to a university program and was back within a month - they were not impressed with the quality of the program - your mileage may vary).

So, sure, intellectually, high school is boring or worse.  On another hand, who said it wouldn't be? Undergrad is pretty much the same thing, except that it's the \"top quarter\" or \"top half\" or something... and now everyone's out from under their parents, and many are able to pose as legally able to buy alcohol, and ... there are drugs...

There is a great deal to be learned from people who are going through the same issues as you are. Relationships, both friendships and romantic attachments, can be easier to form with people who are closer to your chronological age.  And there are many milestones that you will miss if you choose to skip nearly three years of high school. Prom, cruising through the senior year, perhaps even voting with your friends\u2013all of these things can be worth experiencing.  That said, high school is not the only way to have a real social life, or to interact with one's peers. You don't need to lose touch with your friends just because you are working at a lab, even in a different city or country. You don't need that your social group is limited to your research group. You can _certainly_ learn a lot from people who have few years' more life experience.  Which works better for you will depend on how much you depend on the school environment for socializing, and how much you prioritize learning.  My own experience was somewhat similar. I was homeschooled, a path which is already associated with social isolation in the minds of many. I studied college texts at home, and after taking a few classes, was off to graduate school by 17. I missed out on both the \"high school experience,\" and the \"college experience.\"  When I started, I struggled with the courseload. I struggled with interacting with people who often seemed to have entirely different interests from mine, and entirely different lives from me. But I had the opportunity to advance to a level of academic sophistication that was better suited to me. And I discovered that many of the older students were just as fun to hang out with as younger people, and that there were plenty of undergraduates worth talking to anyway.  It's not really a zero sum game; that's the point. You don't have to become a social misfit in order to advance in your education. If you're motivated, you can find plenty of social and personal growth even in a very different academic environment.  "

Going to the prom is way over-rated.\"  A more nuanced answer is that you need to understand the trade-offs. How good is the High School you are currently attending? If 80% of the students go to a 4-year collage and 20% go to a top-10 college, then there is value is sticking around. If the relevant numbers are 12% and 0%, you need to leave now.  I went to college at the age of 16, and it definitely affected my choices. I got into my safe school, but not into any of my first choice schools. Subsequently, I took a couple of years off, and then got into a good grad school, but the whole thing was sub-optimal. In my case, the choice was either a second-rate university, or a third-rate High School. You need to take a cold, hard look at what your choices really are.  You have the advantage of getting good advice. I suspect that you have had good advice up to this point, or you would not have even known that internship programs exist.  If I had to make one recommendation, it would be to figure out how to have the internship count towards getting a High School diploma, and then go to college at the usual age. For most people, their age is a very important parameter in where they get accepted, and in how well they do academically.  "

Using this train of thought, you should take the prestigious internship even if you have to drop out of school. Once you have completed your work program, you can always go back to school. Unless you are the next \"Bill Gates\" and can rise to the top of your profession without more schooling.  The exception to the above is if you come from a country where once you drop out of school, you can never get back into the \"system,\" and most employers look more to schooling than to work experience.

In addition, if you do a good work in your masters, it's not unlikely that the company may offer you a scholarship to do your PhD in the same field, which is extremely important. Not to mention that you can establish contacts with people from the industry.  There is really very little difference between what you call \"industrial\" theses and \"academical\" theses.

And yes, some departments use cut scores anyway so if you don't meet their (often unpublished) minimums your app gets tossed.  Is it worth applying? If you can spare the ~$100ish US dollars, sure - the worst case scenario is you don't get a yes, and you'll most likely get a nice generic rejection email telling you how many applications they had this year and they just can't take everyone who's great.  The more important point is that you have only mentioned a few of the world's most famous institutions on planet earth at this time in history. All of them receive many hundreds of applications, and some applicants with no obvious negative marks, letters of reference from leading professors at that institution, and a masters degree from another famous institution (sometimes even that same place) and/or a bachelor's from another famous place...still do not get accepted routinely. If you'll only be happy with the least likely outcome, you are most likely to be disappointed. So if it's potentially a good fit for you and you have the extra funds, you can certainly apply - but I don't think it's helpful or wise to make it Plan A.  I suggest you apply to the famous places just to satisfy that drive to do so, but dig deeper. Look for places with a more specific fit to you with 2-3 people who are doing work that excites you, look for places you'd have an awesome opportunity at even if the institution name isn't a Hollywood- shorthand for smartypants (as the Batman Lego movie says, \"Harvard for cops\", or in this case \"Harvard for engineers\"), and search for places that also offer a variety of expertise that you think is interesting even if it doesn't seem like a perfect fit at first (if you get in you might find on a visit that there is something that just blows you away you never thought about).  The process has a serious random component, and there is no well-ordered universal ranking of students, faculty, programs, departments, or institutions - i.e., there is no true best-worst that everyone agrees on. You just need to find one \"yes\" that works for you and your goals. Don't talk yourself out of aiming high, but don't let other people's marketing get in the way of your long-term happiness.

        "answer_body": "  I am assuming that by \"proper\" research you mean writing publications. I am not in the field of medicine, but to my knowledge, exposure to current research is generally low in Undergraduate degrees. They tend to teach the basics- which are written in introductory books, not state-of-the-art journal articles. Politics students starting out, wishing to learn about how Trump got elected, will have to start by learning about the US party system, the electoral system, the role of the presidency, election campaigns, and so on.  I think that the best way to start research is to be a good and active undergraduate student. You are learning the things that prepare you for your postgraduate studies and eventually beyond. You say you don't want to summarise literature, but come up with your own ideas. You also say that you don't know what interests you yet. You can't do one without the other. By reading the literature and the standard material, you gain an insight into what some of the ongoing issues and discussions are. By reading up on those issues further, you will eventually end up where current research is going. Literature reviews are necessary- I remember my 60+ established Professor and PhD supervisor groaning about the literature review he had to carry out for a paper he was working on. This does not stop.  That said, I think there are plenty of things you can do to get involved early and develop your interests. A few things come to my mind:    1. Read journal articles! Your university should be subscribed to many journals in your field- and if not, there are still plenty of open-access journals that you can read. Reading articles can give you an idea of the current research and might give you ideas about what you find interesting to pursue further.   2. Speak to members of staff and ask for potential research assistantships. They come at different levels- some require near-PhD experience, others involve boring data-collection and lab work that requires little training. RA jobs are a good way of exposure to ongoing research: while the work you do may be boring, you are still involved in an ongoing project and depending on the field and the type of RA job, you may even be listed as an author.   3. Find student-led journals that publish well-written courswork or projects. Some universities have student journals that you can submit your coursework to- usually it has to be of a high standard. Submissions are reviewed and edits will be suggested- this is a good way of learning the publishing process in a friendly environment.    4. In the case that you have not begun your dissertation or final year project yet: Come up with some ideas and present them to a member of staff. Ask them what they think about the viability of pursuing the topic beyond your undergraduate. They may point you in the right direction.  Again, I am not working in medicine, so there may be opportunities specific to the field.

        "answer_body": "  Although I am not versed in how undergraduate research is viewed in South Africa, I will answer from a U.S. perspective.  Your best bet as an undergraduate is to approach professors who are doing work that interests you. It is okay to not have specific research experience in a field: you have to start someplace, and professors will know this. There may be jobs posted for undergraduate students, or you could ask professors you have taken courses with if they have room in their lab or if they know another professor who is looking for undergraduate help. Tell them what you are able to offer: you want research experience, you are interested in topic X, you can commit Y hours per week, you took a lab course in Z. Be prepared for and not discouraged by rejection, not everyone will have time or space for new undergraduate.  If you are most interested in _clinical_ research, your opportunities may be more limited but the basic approach is the same: approach physician-scientists who do work that interests you.  Sometimes (again, this is in the U.S.) there are credit-based positions available for undergraduates where you will do some work and get credit rather than pay for the time you put in.  In general, as an undergraduate, my opinion is that your experience in a lab should be a hybrid between the work you do for the lab and the knowledge you gain. The work you do might be menial at first: washing dishes, preparing solutions, caring for research animals or cell lines - these tasks take minimal training, so you can be useful immediately. However, you should also be involved in technical conversations, you should be reading new literature in your field (and discussing papers with your colleagues), and over time you should be learning more advanced or specialized techniques.  If you are able to spend more than a year or so in a lab, you should expect to be involved in a real project that could potentially lead to a publication, though it will probably not be your own project - that's okay, you will still be learning skills that apply to your future research endeavors (or, alternatively get you enough experience to learn that you don't enjoy a particular approach).

Moreover, you arrive at university with a larger math background and understanding, struggle less with the material and are probably more likely to retain what you see in the lectures. For instance, separating the nontrivial ideas from the tedious details is much easier when you already have a lot of experience in solving problems and writing proofs.  And in maths, everything you know can suddenly become useful in another field. It's useful to have already seen something. As a numerical analyst, I have on occasion used ideas from other fields in my research: combinatorics, algebra, inequalities...  That said, Olympiads tend to produce \"problem solvers\" rather than \"theory builders\", and some students burn out after doing maths for so many years (but it's a very small minority) or lose focus in the lectures at the undergraduate level because they find them not challenging.  Disclaimer1: I have been an IMO contestant twice, and now I am heavily involved in the organization of the Italian Math Olympiad.

        "answer_body": "  Disclaimer: I participated in the International Math Olympiad, and have a PhD in operations research, which is essentially a type of applied math.  There is some overlap between math olympiads and research math. However, as others have noted, mathematics is a very broad field, which includes subfields such as: algebraic topology, theoretical computer science, combinatorics, control theory, optimization, statistics/machine learning. The amount of overlap with math olympiads depends very much on what subfield of \"research math\" you are referring to. Math olympiads have more overlap with say combinatorics, and less with say control theory.  In training for math olympiads, I learned how to try special cases to get intuition about how a problem works, and how to simplify a problem step by step, and how to write a logical and complete proof. I also learned how to persevere, and to enjoy the challenge of tackling problems which are difficult, and also when to give up when sometimes I am just stuck. I think that these are skills that also are required in research math.  Therefore, I think that there is positive but imperfect correlation between performance at math olympiads and performance in research math. If you don't do very well at the IMO, you can still be a successful pure math professor; and if you get a perfect score at the IMO, that does not mean you are guaranteed to have a successful research math career.  Finally, the math olympiad is an artificial competition, in that the problems in the olympiad can all be solved in a fairly short time with a relatively small set of tricks. On the other hand, in the real world, research math is much more open ended, you need to find and define your own research problems, and oftentimes the problems cannot be solved!  I would use the analogy that olympiad math is like an RPG such as [The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Breath_of_the_Wild), whereas research math is like real life, extremely messy and open ended.

However, to directly answer your question, math competitions themselves are not directly used for research purposes.  "

They are not research questions. However, you can easily make an argument that the IMO _process_ helps mathematical research by encouraging young talent (see some of the other answers).  > Do these math notes/books give good overview for research work?  No, if you mean an overview of _current_ research. Research is heavily sub- specialized. IMO must be accessible to not yet super-specialized high school students. However, in a very general sense, IMO questions and research both involve a fair bit of writing proofs; perhaps IMO can be considered an _\"overview\"_ for research in that sense.  "

      "question_body": "  I have recently decided to enter a grad school in one of the Japanese universities (namely, TiTech). It seems that the general recommendation is to start as a non-degree research student first and prepare for entrance exam while being a research student. After reading [this](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/24031/what-is-a-research- student) question, I still don't understand what is expected from a research student. On one hand, it is a first step before doing a masters degree, on the other - I find the explanation very confusing. After all, the word \"reasearch\" in \"research student\" is there for a reason, right?  My question is - do I have to come up with a research proposal before contacting my potential academic supervisor? I have found a professor doing a research in field I am interested in (inductive and abductive logic programming in AI), but the problem is that this is not something you can get experience with in undergraduate studies. It doesn't come up in an undergraduate curriculum, so I have only a general understanding of the topic. Starting a novel research (if that's what research student should do) without some background will be very hard. Yet I cannot get this background unless I get at least an Ms in AI first.  This is especially worrying given my background. I graduated from my university 10 years ago and was employed all this time as a software engineer. I have a good GPA (4.99 out of 5), and I lived and worked in Japan for 6 years and got a JLPT N2 certificate. However my bachelor thesis was about image processing, not about AI, and in any case it is not particularly relevant after so many years in industry.  ",

As the answer to the other question states, a research student has literally no responsibilities whatsoever. The apparent point is to allow foreign students time to study for the entrance examination for the formal graduate program. They might give you as little as four months (roughly) or as much as a year before the exam is held.  Your advisor may or may not recommend that you sit in on classes and learn how the university works. If you are in the sciences, there's a good chance that you will be assigned to a research team in preparation for entering the college. If you are in the humanities, it's likely that your only responsibility will be to try to pass the examination. If you are already familiar with your field, you will have an extreme amount of free time.  \"Research student\" is actually kind of a misnomer. During my pre-acceptance year I did independent research on my own initiative (mostly because I was bored) and had two papers accepted for publication, but my advisor did not ask what I was doing, and my office did not know I had published papers until after I was accepted as a masters student.

This recommendation is for people who go to Japan on a Japanese government scholarship, and is due to the fact that the scholarship only covers your airfare when you go to Japan _after_ having been admitted to your desired program. Thus, if you want to directly enroll in a masters (or doctoral) program, when you go to Japan to take the entrance exam you do so at your own expense, whereas if you start as a research student there is normally no need to go to Japan beforehand.  In your case, since you're probably not going to Japan on a government scholarship, coming as a research student first does not seem really necessary, unless you really need some time to prepare for the entrance exam to your desired masters program. Keep in mind however that without a scholarship, enrolling as a research student does cost money.  As I said in the linked question, _all_ the details of what you will do as a research student are to be agreed with your supervisor. Of course, no reasonable supervisor would expect you to be able to do original research straight out of undergrad...  "

Short answer: no. Aside from the professor writing in his letter that he did indeed not do the work and just put his name front to brush up his CV, I see no way how you can _prove_ that you were indeed the \"actual\" first author. And, given that this would essentially mean that the professor confesses unethical behavior, I see very little chance of this happening.  Anyway, I am not so sure whether being first author means \"everything\" for you. Undergrads are often not the first authors of publications (for many reasons, not just the unethical reason that you were denied first authorship). Further, if I see a paper with a senior author and an undergrad, I am not assuming that the professor did most of the hard work and undergrad just advised - independently of how the authors are ordered. I would assume your average admission committee to be similarly realistic.  "

Generally everyone knows the deal with academia and tenure-track, it's an imperfect little world, people will understand he is under pressure from his own tenure-track metrics. Yes it's somewhat bad ethics, but this is utterly different to omitting your name entirely, stealing your idea for a startup or patent, esp. when rejecting the associated thesis, stealing your funding and redirecting it to other purposes etc. Outside in the real world noone gives a **** if you were first named author; at interviews or in applications you will be given adequate chance to demonstrate whether you were/were not the prime mover; in fact people may respect the team-member vibe if you diplomatically say \"we\" and \"our idea\" while making it blatantly obvious you did the work and wrote the professor's promotion ticket.    2. **To quote Def Leppard's fine song, \"Let It Go...\"** You have to answer this question: on a scale of 1-10, how was prof's behavior overall, and factor in \"he told me he will compensate in my recommendation\". Sounds like an 8/10 to me. Believe me, there are scumbags out there, and it ain't him.    3. Pretty self-evident, and irrelevant. Notebooks, notes, SCM checkins, emails, drafts.

My professor and I recently submitted a paper on arXiv (submitting for publication soon) that falls in the domain of quantum physics. Here's the [link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.01609.pdf). I really liked enjoying working on the project, and I found it to be a valuable learning experience.  I, however, don't wish to apply to graduate school in physics and specialize in quantum mechanics -- and the study of open quantum systems etc. Ideally, I'd like to join a mathematical physics research group, working of such topics as quantum gravity etc. with a mathematical focus or working on the mathematical aspects of various sub disciplines (quantum mechanics, topological insulators etc.).  I'm aware that being able to demonstrated the ability to do research prior to the graduate level is highly valued at US universities. My question is how will the graduate admissions committee(s) view this (potential) paper? It's already hard to get a spot in various mathematical physics research programs. Will they consider this publication as having no value to them, since the paper doesn't directly coincide with their sub-discipline? Or (if I spin it right), is it possible/expected that they'll view this as an indication of the student's ability to work outside of classroom, work on a project etc.  **Edit -- How I intend to spin it.** I'd like to use this paper to convince the graduate admissions committee follows: I come from a non-physics background ( major), and I have been studying physics/mathematics (in class, out of class etc.) for the last 2-3 years, and I wish to apply in 1-2 years. I started working on this paper after 1 year of studying physics in class. My first year was quantum mechanics (QM) heavy (three courses). The professor suggested the problem, which mostly used ideas from QM and some basic ideas from quantum information. I worked on the project with him and given my experience of having made the transition, making the first year of transition QM intensive and then working on a QM related problem and producing something with/with the help of a professor (regardless of its impact), I'm thinking of selling it as an indication that I can work outside of class, even when I (had to) make the transition; more importantly, given a problem related to the material I had covered after making the transition, I could produce something.  I know I'm more of \"selling it\" rather than \"linking it with my future research interests.\" How does this sound in terms of having an impact on the committee and how they'll evaluate me (and my unusual situation).

There are some metamorphoses that are even more extreme - I have a friend who started as a mathematician, then did a master in bioinformatics and finally moved into a PhD in Philosophy of Science. In summary, reviewers will be looking first and foremost at your capacity and commitment to do research on whatever topic you have chosen in the past as a prove that you will commit to the master\u2019s topic in the future. All that being said, here are some recommendations:    * Talk to your Professors. Inform them about you master choice with details? Do they think you are suited for that specific master? They may consider your choice is not appropriate for your profile and be willing to support you for a different master (but not the one you chose in the first place.)    * Draw attention to projects that relate the most to your current application. Are you applying to a master in cognitive psychology? Then talk about your project on that topic in you cover letter/CV/letter-of-intent.    * Highlight those skills that may be useful in your masters **even if you learned them in a research project whose topic was unrelated to the master thesis**. This recommendation also applies for general skills that are useful in almost any masters, e.g., quantitative skills.   * Related to the first bullet. Try to secure good letters of recommendation from Professors with whom you worked on topics related to your master application. If that is not possible, at least try to secure good letters of recommendation.   * Finally but not less important, show that despite being spread during your bachelor, you are now committed and passionate about that specific masters topic. Indeed, you can say shopping all those topics gave you insight to make an informed decision.  Remember, an application is not simply a list of things you did in the past, but a statement to draw attention on the most relevant landmarks during studies and on how those events shaped your current choice.

Similarly it will work on psychology. You may or may not specialize in something, and without specialization you cannot get the position of a specialist. But you can still be a generalist and specialize relatively fast, so you can get some specialist positions.  Sorry for a messy answer, but that is life, in my applied math dept. one PhD is an ex-instructor of special forces. The life is dynamic as are the positions. Only the positions where something must be done fast require exact specialists that have the needed specialization on spot.

This is not an ironclad rule, and demonstrated expertise (or at least experience) in an advisor's topic of interest is always a plus. But advisors are generally looking for research potential. A good way of demonstrating this is via work with a professor that culminates in a research publication, or at least convinces your supervising professor that you'll be a valuable researcher eventually. It's not common for an advisor to hire you to continue your undergrad research.  This is different when hiring for, say, tenure-track faculty positions, where you need a convincing story and coherent research direction to sell yourself.  At this level it is enough to demonstrate that you know what research _in general_ is like and have some aptitude for it.  As a side note, I would also think carefully about the different projects you participated in. Why did they all interest you? There may be a common, coherent theme underlying all of them.

Last Spring, the college held a research conference and I did REALLY well with one judge (49/50) and poorly with another. The judge I did poorly with cited the wrong research project, or whoever tallied the scores assigned the wrong score sheet to me. Another professor was upset about how her student was judged too, and so when she heard about how I was judged, she grouped us together in one complaint, but our emails to the people in charge of the conference went largely unanswered regarding her student, and _completely_ ignored regarding my situation.    2. Weeks later, a student in my research group who had been receiving massive praise from the honors college for having presented at a conference, received an award for her research. I was actually the one that went to the conference, not her. It was known by the honors college that I went, but they must have assumed the other girl went too because she was in the same group. Perhaps I should have stepped in and said, \"She didn't go, it was just me,\" when she first received praise, but I felt I was in an awkward place. I asked the girl early on in the school year to correct the honors advisor, but she (the girl) said it wasn't important. Our research advisor assured me there's no way of knowing that the trip to the conference was the only factor in the college's decision to give her the award and that she had not been consulted about it, which made the situation a bit less discouraging. That student _did_ do research in another lab -- although I had heard complaints about her work in the other lab well before she and I were at odds.  A few weeks ago, I talked to the dean of the honors college about the situation, and I was pretty much told, \"Sorry 'bout cha', that's life. Life is unfair.\" It made me feel like I was being really petty, and his tone made me feel chastised for bringing it up.  To me, **this isn't an issue about praise, it's about fairness, responsibility, and supporting students.** The \"life is unfair\" argument he used just _really_ bugs me. In my view, something like having an excruciatingly painful, lifelong health condition is a \"life isn't fair\" situation. \"Life isn't fair,\" for me, fails to be a legitimate argument for people refusing to be accountable for their actions or even just issuing an apology.  Despite support from professors, my research advisor, and the Dean of Students, I'm still really gutted about these things. I'm demotivated in my coursework and research (research was seriously my lifeblood.) I worked so incredibly hard and I used to get so much joy just out of working without the need for recognition.  **How do I feel confident and motivated again in my education and research when I feel unsupported?**  ",

I think it's really healthy to be disappointed at unfair treatment: for one thing, this kind of disappointment is a key component in learning to treat others fairly; for another, indifference to being treated poorly could be dangerous just as absence of pain on being burned could be dangerous.  It is however good to cultivate a sense of perspective on such matters. When unfair treatment has serious, lasting negative consequences, you should fight back. When it's a passing thing, sometimes it is better to take just one quick shot at rectifying the situation, and sometimes it is better just to let it go. Let me ask you this: **What are the specific negative consequences of what happened to you? Are they durable? Will they affect your future?**    * With regard to the first case: I am a tenured full professor, and I have never had my academic research formally judged and graded at a conference. So I honestly don't know what you lost out on by being judged poorly. Maybe some words of praise, a line on your CV, and/or a small cash prize? These are not serious losses. The experience seems to have hurt your morale. I understand that, but I think you can easily shake it off with the right perspective. Two people evaluated your research. One person gave you an excellent evaluation, and one person gave you a poor evaluation. Already that's not so bad. But wait, it gets much better: the person who evaluated your work poorly _had you confused with someone else_. So actually no one really thought your work was poor. Isn't that great?    * The second situation is similar in that in fact you are only receiving positive feedback. If going to a conference in Pittsburgh is praiseworthy and you went to the conference, then _the praise actually applies to you_. The person who gave the praise may not know that, but you know it, and that's much more important. By the way, when a student award is for something subjective like \"good research\" rather than being best with respect to an explicit metric, awards are very often given to graduating students rather than non-graduating students. If an award was given to a graduating student in your research group and you feel more accomplished already than that student, you have quite a good shot at getting the award yourself when you graduate.  There is a general theme here: successful academics are largely self- motivated. And for most academics, the greatest reward and job perk is the satisfaction they derive from their own understanding and achievements, both at any given time and the experience of being on a steady upward trajectory of mastery and accomplishments. (I am reminded of my college's alma mater: _Let knowledge grow from more to more; and so be human life enriched._ ) Praise and rewards are not _insignificant_ \\-- among other things, they are key checks on our own self-evaluation -- but they ought to be _less significant_ than your internal sense of your own academic trajectory. If you actually love research -- and it sounds like you do -- then that is your reward right there. I'm not saying you should ignore the rest, but as above you can try to put it in perspective.  To address your questions:  > Is this kind of thing common in academia?  The specific nature of the bumbling you describe is not necessarily so common (though bumbling of one kind or another is hardly rare). But being underappreciated largely by mistake or inattention is rather common, I'm afraid. Every academic I know can spin a wrenching yarn about excellent work which was treated rather shabbily by others.  > More importantly, how do I feel confident and motivated again in research > when I feel really unsupported?  That's a very personal question, but I have given some part of what I hope is a helpful answer. Namely, you have to do you. Being unsupported through what you can clearly and rationally perceive are the faults of others rather than your own should not discourage you from continuing in academia. It may mean that there is a better place for you, but good news -- repeated changes of location which bring new mentors, collaborators and subsidiaries are a key feature of academia. As I mentioned, in each of your stories above there is clear positive feedback on your work and no clear negative feedback -- so I see absolutely no reason for you to lose confidence _in yourself_ and in _your own work_.  The point of being in an \"honors college\" is not accumulating honors, by the way. (To be frank, the terminology is really pretty silly, and even somewhat off-putting.) Rather it is about being given extra opportunities and being guided towards more rapid mastery: to say it slightly mathematically, it is about increasing the slope of your academic trajectory. Giving a student an award for going to a conference is also a bit silly, like giving a child an award for bringing home a good book from the library: yes, there was some praiseworthy behavior involved, but the important part is the _opportunity_ , not the praise for receiving it, and whether the opportunity was used well and/or turns out to be significant is for the person who received the opportunity to judge, not the person who gave the praise. Would you rather have the praise and not the book or the book and not the praise? Clearly the book is preferable...if you actually want to read it. Similarly, I hope you will see that by going to the conference and not getting the praise, you _were_ supported more (in this one instance, anyway) than your colleague who was lavishly praised for a conference that she didn't attend! Ask yourself whether you enjoyed the conference. If you did, there's your motivation.  "

There will be many instances when it happens to you - I could tell about situations over all my studies to the end of my postdoc, where something seemed 'unfair' to me - but in average it will be more or less fair.  There are a few thing by which you can live with it and reduce it to a minimum:    * pacta sunt servanda: if somebody does not keep up his end of an agreement, remind him once, then try to stop collaborating at a time when it's good for you   * go for groups where there are a lot of co-authors on the publications. In my observation these groups usually have a good collaboration internally (since people will not be jealous and fighting)   * when looking for a PhD position: look for a supervisor where people consistently stay (master-phd/phd-postdoc).   * save your fights for the relevant times. Complaining in order to be co-author on a Nature paper where you contributed is reasonable, fighting about anything below co-authorship for impact factor smaller than 5 is not.  "

The answer depends quite a lot on the degree of the difference (both the difference in reputation between universities, and the difference in how well each professor will end up knowing you personally).  As you have intuited, a recommendation from someone at a well-known institution is worth a lot more than a recommendation from someone at an institution that is not well known. On the other hand, a recommendation that describes your specific talents at mathematics in complimentary detail is worth a lot more than a perfunctory letter that says \"Algebraically speaking did a thesis in my institution.\" (Meanwhile, you know nothing at all about the letter-writing skill of either professor, which is another important variable.)  There is also the impact on your development as a researcher. You would likely benefit from working with someone who takes a close personal interest in you. You would also likely benefit from being at a well-known institution that attracts many talented students and has a very productive research atmosphere.  Your decision will ultimately be a personal one, and we can't give personal advice on Academia.SE. However, since your goal is to go to graduate school abroad, I _would_ suggest the following:  **Find out where undergraduate students who work with each professor end up.**  You can ask them directly, or talk to their students. In either case, you'd like to know:    * how many of their undergraduate students _want_ to go on to graduate school in mathematics? How many of these actually do?   * for the students that went to graduate school, _where_ did they go? Are these institutions _you_ would consider attending for graduate school?  The \"road less traveled\" can be great, and rewarding, and all that. But it's also more difficult. If there is a well-traveled path that leads to your desired outcome, **get on that path** if you can.  "

I am now back at university, half way through my third year.  About half way through my work placement (which I thoroughly enjoyed), my supervisor suggested that the work I was doing could be considered publishable. Being an undergraduate this was (and is) obviously a very exciting prospect. It turned out that we did decide to write a paper, and my supervisor said to be that I would get to be the first author. I don't understand much, but I'm under the impression that's something to be excited about too.  I finished with all the analysis and wrote a draft of the paper. It was then time for me to leave my placement and my (now ex-)supervisor are still in correspondence, whilst he finalizes the paper. There have been various (unrelated) issues which have held him back from spending time on it - but he suspects (as it stands) that he will _possibly_ finish it and submit it to a journal by the end of February. He's basically completely reformatting a lot of the paper, and probably rewriting a whole bunch of it, because being an undergraduate I have no idea how to write a paper. Of course this means that if I do turn out to be first author, my supervisor has probably been very generous.  Long story short - if things go well and the paper is accepted in whichever journal, is this a big deal or nothing to be so bothered about? I ask basically to figure out where this ranks in terms of putting it on a C.V. (or something). Is this something to simply add on as an achievement, or something to really highlight?

You don't ask a university or department for a doctorate, there is no process to submit a thesis and have it evaluated on your own, it's all driven by faculty members and you won't even be allowed to defend a thesis if it's not endorsed by one (he or she would also typically help you recruit a jury).  Realistically, a mediocre thesis can be validated if a professor puts his or her mind to it, asks friends to sit in the jury, etc. but even brilliant work is nothing if you don't find an interested academic to move the process along.  Beyond that, others have mentioned extra requirements but the thesis is really the most important thing. In my experience, in Europe (I got my PhD in the Netherlands but I know a little bit about France, Germany, or the UK), it's increasingly common to organise some mandatory courses for PhD candidates but the load is very light, a few short courses about soft skills or methodology with no exam, only pass/fail based on attendance. And there are ways around that if you have a good reason.  But to be perfectly honest, your question suggests you are not very familiar with academia so it seems highly unlikely you would succeed in getting a PhD without proper support. I am not sure why you want one but if it's important to you, it might be a better idea to simply enroll in a PhD program.  "

If the paper has merit, you may be able to present it at a colloquium of your university, at a workshop, or even at a conference. If you put some more work into it and are lucky, you might eventually be able to publish it in a journal. Certainly, your paper will open up more questions than it answers. Now you have a research trajectory that you can follow up and that may lead to a PhD thesis, based on but surely not limited to your first paper.  In other words: There is no reason why you should not start to work on your PhD topic already as an undergraduate, **but it seems to me that you underestimate the time and work it takes to finish the PhD**. And since PhDs require a lot of work, there are PhD programs, which facilitate the process and in which most PhDs are actually produced. In that sense, writing your PhD outside of the designated framework is a bit like digging a well with a spoon. It can be done, but it is not too efficient. On top of that (as others have said already), at many institutions, the written thesis is only one requirement among others to be awarded a title.  "

In principle, if you manage to establish a strong positive connection with the \"famous professor\" and will collaborate or simply keep in touch with him, this could be beneficial for the rest of your academic carrier: he may not only write a strong recommendation letter for grad school, but also introduce you to his professional network (traditionally conservative academic circles will accept you more easily), help to find a postdoc and a tenure-track position, and, finally he could write a letter for tenure promotion for you. On top of this, if you will continue to collaborate with him, your co-authored papers will be more easily accepted by good journals, etc.  On the other hand, \"as they said mostly I will follow his phd students.\" This is a very strong indicator that he will not have time for you (this is typical for famous professors with large groups) and you will be supervised by his PhD students. In this case, interaction with the professor will be minimal, and, if he agrees to write a letter, he will ask students who supervised you to assist. There is a chance that you would remain a sort of unknown to him.  The \"less-famous\" professor, however, is likely to have more time for your. And you could learn (and benefit in other ways) much more from him than from PhD students of the famous professor. Remember also that a very strong and enthusiastic letter from a less-famous professor is better than a modest letter from the top one.  So, as I said, it is a tough choice.  I would recommend:    1. Try to find out what happened with other undergrads who where interns in both groups (famous and less-famous). Where are they? If possible, contact them and ask about their experience.    2. Focus on how comfortable it is for you to communicate with both professors on a personal level. You could also ask them how often you should expect to interact with them.     3. Don't reflect too much on \"The thing I am concerning is as he is a leading person in top universities, he must be surrounded by lots of smart persons.\" You got the internship.

Fundamentally, in an exam, you are expected to _know_ the answer to the questions you ask. How are you going to evaluate different proposals? Does a student who writes a simplistic answer that won't work get more points than a student who recognises how difficult the issue is and consequently is unable to come up with a comprehensive solution (and writes nothing at all)?   * **It probably won't work**. An exam is not a brainstorming exercise. Your students are under time pressure, and they will assume that there is a reasonably simple solution to the problem. They are not gonna throw crazy ideas that might just work at you, but instead they are going to waste a lot of precious exam time trying to find the \"obvious\" solution that you yourself have not yet found. An exam is not the right frame for creative problem solving.  "

      "question_body": "  A few months ago, I was assigned a task by my lecturer to create a Decision Support System program in a group of three. The task itself was intended as the final assignment of the course. My group discussed for some minutes and in conclusion my idea was accepted because it's new as far as we know and could really help those who need it.  Unfortunately due to conflicting schedules throughout the last half of the semester I was forced to do it alone. One was on internship and the other guy seemed to be quite difficult to contact.  Well, I don't care how important they see this assignment, but looking at the deadline I thought I'd rather do it alone than abandoning the assignment. I know it was wrong and foolish, but I needed the grades. I could always teach my group members how to make programs like this one. I thought as long as I ensure they too experience something like what I did in this work, I guess I can let it slide for that single time (of course with a stern warning as a minimum bonus).  OK, so I made the program by myself back then. I asked my other friend about the matter. He was a graduate student and excel at this field to teach me whether my program was effective enough or not. He was surprised that I made the program alone and told me that he thought this work I've done might be eligible to submit as a scientific paper. I've pondered over it and I think he could be right.  As a side note this other friend I'm talking about is actually the one whose master's thesis inspired me to make this DSS.  Then here comes the problem. I want to publish this as my first scientific paper but if I included my groupmates' names it would be a problem. A big problem as they didn't do the work themselves. But at the same time I think it would be weird if I suddenly publish it under my name only.  As they too have their names written on the student's report (and I can't really change that), do I need to make some kind of an agreement letter that state they grant all the research materials to me?  PS:    * Please notice that I'm asking about authorship. I've learned that it was foolish of me to write their names on the report.    * I certainly need to ask my lecturer's opinion about the material, but my predicament above (or perhaps my guilty conscience) barred me from directly asking the lecturer.    * I want to limit my question to authorship matter.

Let me be blunt -- could their grades for this assignment be reduced to zero, adversely affecting their marks, because the publication resulted in a review of your assignment?

I'm interested in attending this school for graduate work, and mentioned that to the prof.  In his response, he was very excited about my interest in his project (work in ocean sciences) and in the graduate program, and asked if I could send a transcript. I'm very happy about the response, because the prof was very enthusiastic, but due to (what I now know was and is) depression, my grades took a dip, which can be seen in my transcript. For reference, I've done poorly in a mathematics class and computer science class in my sophomore year (2 Cs, and a D in a genetics course, but that's unrelated to this project). Since then, I've gotten Bs in Calc III and Adv Calc (the only other courses relevant so far).  I know this is not a representation of of my ability, as I've done research projects utilizing the material from classes I've done poorly in, and have done well in the projects. At the same time, I don't want to make excuses for myself, and I don't know if it's fair to disclose that information to the prof to make him choose between a candidate like me, and someone else who is \"normal\".

Also, if there are any specific accommodations you would find helpful during the summer project, let him know what those are.  Speaking of accommodations, if you are in the U.S., but don't have ADA accommodations (also known as 504 accommodations) set up, this would be something to consider looking into. If you are interested, you could start by    * looking at your college's office for students with disabilities web pages to see what documentation they require;    * thinking about what accommodations would be most helpful for _you_.

I however feel that the courses offered by my university's mathematics department are not at all challenging for me, and that is quite frustrating. I currently achieve 100% on every paper I write and I do not attend any lectures. Instead I opt to study on my own.  I spoke to the head of our university's mathematics department, explained my situation, and asked if I could be granted permission to take higher courses, and his response was essentially _'Who are you to ask me such a question?'_  The difficult part is that there is almost nobody whom I can talk to about mathematics that I'm studying. _It feels as if I'm working in complete isolation_. The only people I can really talk to are some of the Masters and PhD students, who are perhaps the sole reason I even go to university to study.  I feel that this lack of competitiveness and being forced to go through courses that have content which I've already studied on my own is hindering my development. What's more, my university's math faculty does not have any official undergraduate research program, nor do faculty members interact much with undergrads (apart from lecturers taking questions from students of their courses).  _I feel stuck, frustrated and depressed as if I'm being held back_. In the US I've heard that it's fairly common for students to take courses at higher levels as they choose to do so, but alas I'm not in the US and don't have this option at any of the institutions in my country.  So in my situation, is there any advice one can give me? Also if there are any students who've been in the same situation as I find myself in, I'd be highly interested to hear how you managed to stay motivated and competitive.  * * *  (As a side note, I would like to mention that I learned what I learned not to _complete courses_ but out of a genuine interest in what I was learning, it just happened to be that what I learned were the courses offered by my university.)  Also I do plan to move abroad for my graduate studies, if I receive a scholarship to do so, however if I don't, I won't have the necessary finances to pursue this.  My main problem is on how to stay competitive and motivated, and pushing myself in an environment that is not challenging nor conducive to research or to those who want to progress faster than the normally accepted rate.

See if you can find a way to go abroad.    3. Stay where you are but try to get into those higher level classes.  3a. Try to get permission directly from the instructor. Maybe you won't get credit for the class -- but if you are permitted to sit it (audit) the class, that's progress. A good way to start working on this would be to visit the instructor's office hours with a couple of good questions that will show your aptitude, level of knowledge, and communication skills. After getting to know the instructor in this way, you could then ask for permission to attend his or her class.  3b. Try going above your department head.  I personally favor method 3b as the preferred approach -- if it works.  Now, what to do about your feeling of isolation? Here are some ideas for you to consider:    1. Do some tutoring/mentoring/teaching. This can be rewarding and can help you break your isolation.    2. Take some classes in fields where one might be able to apply some tools of applied math or statistics.    3. Get started with one or more interdisciplinary projects with folks in other departments.    4. Interact with mathematicians in other countries with email, letters, etc. Here's one way to get started with this: read some papers you're interested in. Write to an author of one of the papers, to say that you read the paper with interest; say what you found most interesting; ask something. You could mention that you would be very glad to be able to correspond with grad students. Then see if a correspondence relationship develops.  "

I'm in a pretty similar situation to yourself but I've managed to have some limited success with what you're trying to do.  I did manage to get permission to take some higher level courses this year but what I think was much more valuable is that I started doing a unofficial reading course with a professor. Essentially I just asked if I could and they were willing. While there might not be many explicit opportunities for undergrads I suspect that some of your professors might be quite happy to help informally, just begin asking.  That said you should probably still keep trying to take higher level courses. Perhaps try asking different people as another commentator mentioned but don't ruin any relationships.  Staying motivated and competitive has been a struggle. Being forced to take loads of courses covering work you already know sucks but it seems like one just has to endure. At this point I view courses as just something I have to do to get a degree and learning mathematics as a more or less separate activity I do because I want to.  One advantage is that you now have plenty of time to learn all the math that interests you instead of just the boring stuff they shove in the curriculum.  It also helps to feel you're at least a little competitive internationally so try to hold yourself to international standards, for example I always try to work through my years Cambridge exams at the end of the year to gauge how I'm doing.  Otherwise if your university has a math club, join that, take the SATMO and try to find professors you can talk to.  Also if it helps, there are students who have managed to get somewhere. I know of one student who went to Princeton and one who went to Cambridge from my university, yours should be similar, so there is hope.  "

We have never had a situation in which an award was refused on the basis that the awardee could make more money elsewhere. I can't speak for other members on the panels I sit, but I (and I believe many others) would take offence at this reason. The details of the award, including the level of funding, are often clearly stated and we would wonder why this consideration was not top of mind prior to submission.  If I was PI on an award that I received and on which you were a part of the team, you refusing to participate on the grant is less of a problem for me. I would write to the awarding body to explain a change in staffing (which happens all the time) and divert the funding to someone else. It's likely that there are many undergraduates wanting to work on the grant anyway and, unless you've got unique skills, I should be able to turn to someone in time. In return, I would ask that you NOT cite this award in your CV because you didn't work on it at all anyway.

Based on your account I'm getting the impression that, with a reasonably high level of confidence, **there is no way for you to \"politely\" decline the grant**. The very action of declining will reflect poorly on you and show you to be an unreliable and difficult to work with person, and is likely to upset your PI and the funding agency who went to the trouble to evaluate your application. So, it's not about the \"how\". It's the action of declining that is by its nature impolite.  You may feel this is unfair. You may feel that you were given inaccurate information at the time of submitting the grant that led you to make a decision you now regret. You may very well be right on both of those points. In an ideal world you would simply explain what happened and everyone would agree that it makes sense for you to decline the grant. However, in the world we actually live in, I'd say accept it, do the work, use it as a learning experience and move on. And congratulations for getting the grant, it obviously says good things about you and if you do a good job has potential to benefit you in the future in many ways other than the measly stipend.  "

Also you'll be honing your presenting skills.

I find that undergraduate students get a better sense of the breadth and messiness of research methods when actually engaged in a research project. In my view, this experience can take place in a number of fields, although I would prefer that this not be the case. The reason is because the experience of research is much more than the method. Beginning students can pick up research habits that are at odds with the way research is conducted in their own field.  Let me give you an example. A medical student wanted to do a systematic review on health promoting hospital design on patient outcomes. She was interested in a particular approach involving an architectural perspective, so she partnered with the academics from the School of Architecture. Now, systematic reviews are performed quite differently in architecture than in medicine. The systematic review was completed and it was a confusing read because the approach was strange. She submitted it to a medical conference with no luck, but it did get accepted in an architecture conference. Good on her. Still, given that her main academic field is medicine, she has admitted to me that she had found it difficult to unlearn some of the habits she picked up in the research project and wished that she had learned within the field.  In another example, I often have quite a number of research tasks requiring completion and regularly issue invitations to undergraduate students to work with me. These tasks involve clinical contexts -- osteomyelitis, carpal tunnel syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea -- that may not be relevant to student assistants from the Department of Civil Engineering or the Department of English Literature. I don't reject student volunteers because of their degree, but inform them that the techniques that they will learn may be less relevant to their degrees.  Good luck to you.  "

That doesn't mean you have to read it in-depth, but you should at least skim it. The same goes for other papers.  There's a couple of reasons for this:    1. Remember the point of a citation is to give credit where credit is due. That means you give credit to the original author, not someone who summarized their idea.   2. What's to say that the authors of the summary correctly summarized the idea? It's (generally) safer for you to go straight to the source.  A notable exception to this rule _might_ be when reading a survey paper/book. These provide overviews of an entire domain -- if you're not actually exploring that domain in your own writing, the survey paper can be an acceptable way of citing an idea.

Perhaps you could post some links if there's something you read on the internet that shaped your thinking about them.  I will describe what I know about the most common research positions for students in the U.S., for comparison purposes.    1. Here's my understanding of how **RAships** most typically work in the U.S. My understanding of an RA position is that it is offered to a grad student. Typically a professor with grant money would offer an RAship to a student he feels is very promising. Typically, the student accepting the RAship would move from a teaching assistanship (TAship) to the RAship, and this would take 20 hours of grading and office hour duties off his To Do list each week, enabling him to focus more intensively on his research. Most often, this type of RAship is offered when the student is a well-known quantity, for example after passing the basic (but substantial) PhD exams (which have different names at different institutions).  However, sometimes a professor will offer an RAship to an entering first-year student.  The RAship, similar to the TAship, comes with a stipend and a tuition deferral. Meaning, you get a bare bones salary, and you get to register for classes at a cost of $0. This is extremely important in the U.S.  My impression is that this tuition deferral is of much less importance (or relevance) in Europe.  An RA might be assigned to do very specific tasks for the advisor, to a greater or lesser degree, but never more than 20 hours per week (averaged out over the semester). In any case, he will be expected to work hard on his own studies which are supposed to lead, eventually, if he's a beginner, or directly, if he is farther along, to a PhD thesis. He will be expected to reporting regularly on his progress. His advisor is supposed to be actively involved in mentoring and guidance throughout the research endeavor.    2. Separate from that, there are **REUs** in the U.S.: Research Experiences for Undergraduates. I see these taking place in the summer, but I'll let you [read about them](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) to see if they are actually only done in the summer or not.  An REU, to be a successful experience for the student, needs to be carefully structured by the scientist mentor.  I imagine there are questions here at Academica SE about how to choose an advisor and how to choose a research project, that could be useful for you. My guess is that this is the important thing for you. (I am not sure that focusing on the financial aspects would be particularly helpful.)  "

        "answer_body": "  Such positions are likely to be extremely rare in The Netherlands (this possibly extends to a number of other European countries with similar bachelor-master structures).  As an undergraduate you are not expected to do much in terms of research. It is not unusual for the only research to be part of a bachelor's thesis, if that. This likely stems from there being no use in this from the perspective of Dutch higher education. You usually don't need research experience (never mind publications) to get into a masters program and it would be highly exceptional if you landed a PhD position without a masters degree.  Once in a masters' program (assuming it is research oriented) you will find more opportunities, though these may simply be research projects that are part of the program and not RA positions. If you do well in such a research project you should find your professor happy to work with you. And while at this level funded RA positions exist I don't believe they are common. And as @MaartenBuis mentions, a professor is likely to know who they want for such a position. Moreover, usually there will be plenty of students looking for a thesis topic that will work for free...  "

I'd love to join the research community, and I guess this would a be good starting point, but there are two issues I'm concerned about:    1. The first is related to the subject itself: (a) I'm not convinced of the quality of the suggested solution. (b) The project tries to solve two different problems.   2. The second issue is that I'm not interested in the field of the project. My interest is in a different field. Though, both are related to computer science.  So, would participating in this paper do any harm to my reputation or my chances of getting into a good graduate program in the field I'm interested in?  **Update:**  Thank you so much for the kind answers. Almost all of you agree that the second issue is harmless, but there are different opinions regarding the first one.  So I said that my supervisor knows better, and I decided to go on and started planning the outline of the paper with his help. When I got to the writing part, I noticed that the main body doesn't relate to or even mention the main problem that we've specified. This is when I decided to decline the offer.

I think it is largely improbable that publishing a paper would harm your career, but it could if, for example, it is really poor and someone happens to read it.  Eykanal in a comment to Dave Clarke said that \"no one would consider holding you accountable for the content of the paper\"; I recall that there is a important trend to insist that _all authors of a paper should be accountable for its content_.  The fact that you do not want to pursue in the direction of the paper is completely harmless, though. There is really no problem working in different areas, the only thing to be careful about is not to spread oneself efforts too much, but this does not apply here.  So the main issue is (a); here I would say that it can be difficult to judge the quality of a result, especially for an undergraduate, and I would advise to trust your advisor. So it is really, really unlikely that co-authoring this paper could do any kind of harm to your career; in fact it could do more harm to decline this opportunity, since your advisor would probably not understand and you will probably need his or her recommendation.  At the end, I do not disagree that much with other answerers; but I would be less general in my statements.  "

Now, I say 'relatively' because this is often hard to get right with the pressure of time and page limits; and with English not being the native language of most researches. So, readers will be somewhat tolerant about this point - but if you write something that is just very hard to follow, or in very poor English, that doesn't reflect well on you.   * **Unfortunately, attention must be paid to the venue of publication.** I must first qualify that... obviously some publications are more highly-regarded w.r.t. their filtering process and the typical quality of articles they carry, and some less so. The thing is, I believe one should not assume that if a paper is published in a 'weaker' journal, that necessarily means it's bad - and if someone is evaluating your qualifications as an academic they should bother to skim the paper itself and make up their own mind. That doesn't always/often happen, so people may well judge your work by looking at where you've published. Of course, this is not something binary (\"good\" journals and \"bad\" journals, or conferences) - but having mostly obscure venues in your list of publications does reflect poorly on you, and in some fields I guess there are venues you should actively avoid even at the price of no publication.  Having said all that - for your first publication, as long as it's not a disreputable venue, it doesn't matter much. Most people \"start out small\".  The last point, about venues, is also a sort of a safety guarantee for you: If you submit a paper to a conference or journal with a good peer-review process, and you're accepted, then it's highly likely that your paper is actually pretty good, and even more likely that it will reflect favorably on you (the converse is not necessarily true of course; lots of good papers get rejected).

Then when someone who is interested in your academic performance asks, you can show them that, yes, you had a rough semester, but you've gotten back on track. **In my experience, recent good performance will very quickly outweigh more distant struggles.** This is true regardless of the reason - you could have the best excuse in the world, but if you haven't shown you're past it and doing better now, who's to say you won't continue to struggle with whatever you're being considered for?  Given that your rough term was just last year, however, the only recourse you have right now is to be open and upfront about it; explain why you struggled and what happened to address the cause. If you have no excuse, then just say that too. It was a rough term, but you're back on track. _This is totally reasonable and far from uncommon in undergrad._ Unfortunately it may be a hard sell if you're currently struggling in this professor's class too. Do you know _why_ the professor made this offer to you in spite of this? That might offer some insight into what they're looking for.  In short, send the transcripts, point out that you struggled but mention what you did to address the cause, and then the ball is in their court. Be prepared for the possibility that the professor is alarmed by what they see, and know that it may take time for you to build up this kind of credibility again. Then focus on your grades.

For example, if squirrels or interesting people outside his office window are drawing his attention, tell him the light bothers you and ask permission to lower the blinds. If he gets mesmerized by his screen saver, ask if it would be okay to turn off the monitor, or position yourself so that his back will be to his monitor. Etc.    * Ask permission to tape record your meetings. Write down your notes later. Keep things moving in your meetings, so that he doesn't have a chance to get too interested in the ceiling.    * Bring along a couple of quiet fidget items, and put them in on the edge of the desk or table, where you can both reach them. For example, one of the modern forms of silly putty. The little donkey who takes a bow when you push up on the base. Etc.    * Observe how many minutes it takes for him to get distracted, subtract 5, and try to wrap up your meetings in that many minutes.    * Have some of your conversations while on a small hike together.    * Give him a yoga ball as a gift, for sitting and bouncing in his office. Tell him you heard it's recommended for optimal back health and concentration.    * Observe what time of day seems to work best, and schedule your meetings accordingly.    * Bring along a high-protein snack to share.    * Allow yourselves a 25% failure rate. Be philosophical about it. As mentioned in a comment -- don't take it personally.  I have experience collaborating with people with ADD and ADHD.

The problem is the perception, and whether you offer it directly or not you could be perceived as trying to sway the admissions committee. For example, a police officer has some leeway in choosing whether to cite you or not; offering the officer $100 is going to get you in trouble, whether you say \"I will give you $100 if you let me go\" or if you say \"Hey I just wanted to let you know how much I care about police officers in general, so I am going to put this $100 on your car, you can take it if you want.\"  Your situation is different because the legality is much less clear than the example I just gave, but I would be uncomfortable accepting a student who wouldn't normally meet the expectations of the university because they were offering the use of some equipment.

        "answer_body": "  **A politically-focused paper may harm your standing among those with an opposing viewpoint.** This perhaps _should not_ happen, but it's an unfortunate reality of human nature.  If you publish a paper that could be interpreted as \"party X is worse than Y\", people (even scientists) are going to read that through a lens of their own biases, to some extent. If they support party X, they may be less likely to believe your conclusions, more likely to challenge you, and/or have an emotional reaction against it. Some people will be able to be impartial and rise above their biases; for others, this may lead to a final judgement about you.  **How much this harms you may depend on which side you take.** There have been many studies showing that college professors tend to overwhelmingly favor one side of the political debate in America. [Here is just one example](http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/oct/27/99-top-liberal-arts- professor-campaign-donations-g/). This effect is far more extreme in some fields than others.  So, another unfortunate reality is that, depending on the side your paper favors, the results may be very different for your career. You might be confirming the beliefs of 95% of your colleagues, or you might be challenging those beliefs. I hate to say this, because it sounds like a suggestion of \"only do this if your finding matches the existing orthodoxy\", which is a highly unscientific approach. But I do think this point needs to be acknowledged.  **A political paper may get a lot more attention than the average paper.** Papers like \"adherents of party X pick their nose a lot more than adherents of party Y\" make great headlines and often get picked up by the media. They are second only to studies claiming that chocolate, beer, etc. are good for you, in terms of press appeal.  More publicity for you is typically a good thing (assuming you are doing good work). The fact that you published a well-known paper can be a great thing to have on your CV. On the other hand, it does raise the stakes. Your paper would be subject to a lot more scrutiny than normal.  In the end, only you can make this decision; there are risks. But my feeling would be **evaluate this very carefully, but do go ahead with it if you think it would make a high quality paper.** Some points on how to proceed:    * **Don't move forward without someone experienced on board.** Make sure you can get some good, respected people's input. Ask them about the general idea before you start, and make sure someone more experienced than you is willing to contribute and be an author if you do go ahead with it.   * **Work hard to overcome your own biases.** I would try hard to find someone with an opposing political viewpoint to review it, to make sure I'm not missing something obvious because of my own bias. There may be an alternative reading of the data which I haven't seen, because I'm predisposed to think ill of party X.   * **Do the work meticulously.** If this paper does get attention, any error or methodological issue is likely to get picked up. Make sure you do everything very carefully, document all your methods, test thoroughly, etc. (Of course you should always do this).    * **Report the findings in as evenhanded a way as possible.** Don't take unnecessary political potshots. Don't assume bad intent where your results don't warrant it. And think about the title you want to give it. Do you want it to say \"Party X is more evil than party Y\" or something generic like \"The relationship between Foo and party affiliation\".   * **Make sure not to claim too much.** Be clear about the limitations of what your work actually shows. It's quite common to see papers that jump to unwarranted conclusions or assume causality where they haven't shown that. Steer clear of such things. Make sure to be clear about your limitations, and if there are multiple possible interpretations of the results, make sure to discuss them all.  "

        "answer_body": "  I would not do this in your case, for the following reasons:    1. As an undergraduate, you almost certainly lack the skills to do top-notch research. That's not to say it's impossible, but there's a reason a PhD researcher takes many more years of much harder courses. The work I did as an undergrad, even one project I won an award for, looks pretty naive to me now. Therefore, putting out partisan research now is very risky; a lot more so than when you're more confident your research can withstand scrutiny.    2. Related to number 1, if your research suggests one party is doing something better than another, it may be _disproportionally harmful_ if your results come about due to poor methodology. As others have said, both national and local media loves to pick up this sort of research, and it isn't always critically evaluated.    3. Even if you were able to find a full professor who was willing to work with you on this idea, and get it into a professional journal instead of publishing somewhere that accepts undergraduate work, the professor is facing a very different set of risks than you. Their career may already be established, particularly if they're tenured, so they're risking a lot less by publishing controversial research than you are.  Instead I would suggest two alternate approaches:    * Shelve the idea and work on it after you've advanced into graduate school, or even beyond, when you're better able to do defensible research and/or are more secure in your research career.   * Refocus the research to be non-partisan. Focus on \"harmful practice Y\", for example, and leave drawing any partisan implications to the reader.  It's good you're having research ideas as an undergraduate, so don't be discourage by this. It's easy to get excited about research ideas, particularly early in your research training, and feel like it's the only good idea you'll ever have. In reality you'll have lots of research ideas, and most of them will almost certainly be better than your first.  "

Your hesitation comes from the fear of confirming the notion ( **that you have developed in your mind** ) that your professor won't want to supervise you because you've done poorly in his class.  Do not stop yourself because of your fear. If he doesn't want to work with you, and he tells you that, you suffer no less than by having never asked him in the first place _as long as you forego your ego_. Instead, almost every other outcome of pursuing this opportunity with your professor has an upside; he may accept to supervise you, or he may decline but give you a lead or suggestion of an alternative (that will at the very least give you a platform to ask more questions and move ahead in your progress). Or simply you will learn more about yourself and your professor.  Don't be afraid. Ask. And when in doubt of situations like this, assume the kindness of others. You'll be surprised at how often this assumption can become actualized once you've tested it (and sometimes, the assumption alone is enough to make it a reality).  "

        "answer_body": "  I have completely different advice than everyone else:  Regarding the testing issue: contact your college's test center/academic support services. Inform them of which test(s) and the specific problem you are having for the first time. You are likely not the first one with this same issue. An alternate format may already be on file or you can retake the test at the test center with extra time allowed. Academic support will explain your options. Many students use these services. Important: faculty are used to working with the college testing facility whatever their system is and must do so only when they are asked to provide content.  If you were to mention a testing issue to your instructor they would refer you anyway, the volume of requests is high and they open themselves/college to lawsuits if the formal route isn't followed. Professors don't think twice about it and certainly would not draw conclusions about you based on your use of this academic service.  Regarding the project, meet with him/her in person and speak to them directly about the project. You can explain your strengths, interests, etc. and make genuine inquires. See if there are reservations you can likely resolve by providing information to him.  For this, definitely use face-to-face dialogue; no one appreciates requests via social media or explanations via email. Do not assume that they made a connection about your progress in the course and your project request. This would result in your display of anxiety at best. Or worse, be an insulted you believe their decision making process is inept.  However, should your coursework come up in conversation you may want to let him know you've experienced a testing issue in this course that you were previously unaware of. And assure him that you are addressing it and have already contacted the support services department.  "

Even though I have been working for over three years with him, he is unwilling to give me the key. Says that I should contact the other senior lab members, and ask for them to open the door.  An issue that came up today that made me vent off some steam on the Academia StackExchange. Instead of going home, I stayed after my morning class so that I could go to the lab and get some research done. However, no one was in the lab. I called my lab mates, but they either had work, had their key taken from them, wasn't answering, had gone on a trip... You get the idea. I ended up investigating the lab equipment of an adjacent lab.  This isn't the first time either. One time I had arranged with two people to come the next day: neither came nor informed me. This is especially inconvenient when the lab is on a remote section of the campus.  I have explained the situation to him, more than one. Once, he said that he would give me the key, but only if I came to the lab more often.

I don't need the key per se, but I do want to perform research. And for that, the lab needs to be open. While the lab mates are helpful, I do understand that they have a life. I cannot force them to come at 7 in the morning only to open the door for me, can I?  I'll add that my work has led to two conference proceedings and both me and my professor are optimistic that it will lead to a high-impact article.

All of these things add up to the following conclusion: you and your advisor don't have a clear understanding of when and how often you'll be working. So you drop by sometimes, find out that no one's there, and maybe that's your fault because somehow you've implicitly agreed to show up as much as you can but at random times. That's not professional behavior!  I see a rather easy fix: first, agree with your advisor how much time per week you'll be spending in his lab. If you hear a \"As much as possible if you don't want me to think you're lazy\" response, you'll have to move the conversation past that. You can _promise in advance_ to devote XX hours per week -- i.e., you have to figure out in advance how many hours -- to the lab. (If you and your advisor can't agree on how much time you'll be spending the lab: sorry, but you don't have a wonderful working relationship, you have an entirely dysfunctional one. But since you have mostly positive feelings about your advisor, I am optimistic that he will listen to reason here.) Then you need to make a schedule with your advisor about exactly when you'll be in the lab. If he doesn't want to give you a key -- okay, but then **it's his problem when you get locked out of the lab, not yours**. Every time that happens, you _don't_ call up every other member of the lab, you leave, and then the next day you approach him and say that unfortunately you couldn't get into the lab at the time you had agreed upon, so is there some aspect of the agreement he'd like to adjust?  Bottom line: if you model the behavior of a professional rather than someone who drops by when he's interested, you'll implicitly challenge your advisor to be professional to you in return. It seems unlikely that someone who cannot rise to the standards of professionalism set by a conscientious undergraduate could be a successful lab director, so I am rather optimistic that this strategy will work for you.

        "answer_body": "  Your adviser is doing the right thing.  **No one, especially not undergraduate students, should work alone at night in a lab.**  It is very unsafe to work alone in a lab. I know that this is very common, because students are young and inexperienced and haven't been around long enough to see what can happen. Just like young guys on motorcycles. Also universities have a can-do atmosphere, where safety is generally seen more as a burden than a requirement.  Of course, advisers often don't mind their students risking their live, because if you do care for the safety of your students, you will not make it in the cutthroat competition we call academia.  Take for example Eric M. Carreira, who pressured his students to work evenings and weekends. <http://www.chemistry-blog.com/2010/06/22/something-deeply- wrong-with-chemistry/>  I am an industrial chemist, and I can assure you, that anyone writing such a letter in the private sector would get fired immediately. In our company, it is formally prohibited to work alone. There have been cases when companies where fined huge amounts by OSHA for such letters, people have actually gone to jail for accidents that happened on their watch. Unfortunately ETH doesn't care about safety and hired this guy.  Here are two recent cases to remind people why it is not a good idea to work alone  > In the early hours of 13 April, undergraduate students working at Yale > University's Sterling Chemistry Laboratory made a shocking discovery. There > in the lab's machine shop was the dead body of 22-year-old undergraduate > student Michele Dufault, her hair tangled in a lathe. She had apparently > died of asphyxiation  www.nature.com/news/2011/110418/full/472270a.html  I'll bet you a dollar, that when anything happens, the adviser, the same who would have claimed authorship of the work, will call you an independent researcher just happening to work in his lab. Patrick Harran of UCLA even claimed that his student who died in his lab, was not his employee, but employed by the university, so it wasn't his job to keep her safe.  > Sheharbano \u201cSheri\u201d Sangji, a 23-year-old University of California at Los > Angeles staff research assistant, died three years ago after suffering > massive second- and third-degree burns when a chemical she was handling > caught fire.  www.insidehighered.com/news/2012/01/03/ucla-faces-criminal-charges-lab- accident  So even though it might be common to work alone, it is unprofessional and dangerous. Don't be the one who gets burned to death or strangled in a lathe, and don't be the eager beaver who thinks it is ok to take risks in the name of science, and don't push others.  You should thank your adviser that he is keeping you safe. It is great to see that some people actually do care. Please tell him thank you.  "

One place I was at had just a single rate all interns were paid, no questions asked. The other had two tiers for interns, one paid slightly better, but which tier it was was dictated by the position in the budget, not by negotiation.  So based on that I would say no, don't negotiate. For better or for worse, there tends to be a line of people waiting to get internships and most of them don't have much to differentiate them from the field (which is why they're going for internships and not full jobs). So it's likely that the criteria they used to select you is fairly thin, particularly with no experience in the field.  Plus with nothing to fall back on your bargaining position is pretty weak, even if they don't know they're your only interview.  "

      "question_body": "  I'm currently a second-year undergraduate physics major, and I joined an experimental nuclear physics (astrophysics primarily) group a few months ago. I joined the group wanting to work extremely hard to learn new things, apply them (and my intuition and previous knowledge) to solve problems, and present my findings and progress on a weekly basis, reporting to the group head on a more frequent basis though. It started out like that at first - the head made me solve a problem, write a GUI/applet for it (just to show that I fully understood the problem), and then implement that into a particular framework that would be used for an actual experiment later on down the road. I noticed that the head also didn't like to be a mentor too much - that is, he only liked to tell me what I needed to know for my task and nothing else, leaving extra learning for myself.  The problem with this is I'm left mentally starved. I've been assisting this other person in my group (relatively new graduate) on preparations for that actual experiment that I mentioned earlier, and that feels good. I've learned more of what's going on behind the scenes (significance of the experiment, theoretical implications of the results obtained, detector and equipment [and setup]) through publications, other people within the university, and asking the group head, but all of this was essentially on my own. As a result, I feel that any average joe with minimal work-ethic and intuition could thrive in a group like this. I've learned a lot more about nuclear physics/astrophysics (hence, more about this universe we live in) through sources that I might have otherwise not come across had I not joined the group, so that's good.  Also, just quick side note, the experiment is coming up soon, and I'm sure I'll learn a whole bunch through that process, and sorting out and analyzing the data after the experiment will certainly put me to work.  I've been thinking about possibly trying to join another research group, just so I can quench my mental thirst. There is a nuclear theory group at my university, and even though I know nuclear theory is probably way over my head, I'm willing to put a lot of time into working hard.  **Here is my question:** Is attempting to join another group a bad idea? Should I instead tell the group head how I feel, and see where to go from there, or would that be far too disrespectful?  Please excuse any ignorance of mine.  ",

You can do either, both, or none of them.  As you see it, you believe your choices are    1. **Talk to your current supervisor** \\- You should absolutely do this, regardless of what you decide to do with respect to the other group. Your mentor has no way of knowing what you're thinking unless you tell him; it's up to you to let him know if you need more from the supervisory relationship. Of course, you should do this in a respectful and adult way.    2. **Join a second research group** \\- You should consider doing this if you're interested in the research the second group is doing. As an undergraduate, it's to your benefit to experience different kinds of research, different advising styles, etc, to help you understand what you need when applying to graduate school. Note, however, that research is very time- and energy-consuming, and if you spread yourself too thin, you will experience \"research\" only on a superficial level and won't get much out of it. Only you can determine whether you _really_ have enough free time and energy to participate in two research groups in a meaningful way.  Finally, I'd like to comment on your statement  > ... all of this was essentially on my own. As a result, I feel that any > average joe with minimal work-ethic and intuition could thrive in a group > like this.  You seem to think that because your mentor gives you a lot of independence and doesn't tell you exactly what to do, that standards and expectations in the group are pretty low. That's not necessarily the case.  The ability to work independently is a highly valued skill in supervisees, and it's **great** that your advisor has given you the chance to show your capabilities in that respect. This means that he'll be able to write strong recommendation letters for your graduate applications - much, much stronger than a supervisor who could only speak to your ability to follow focused, specific instructions.  Research is not like coursework. It's _supposed_ to be highly self-directed. If somebody is telling you exactly what to do and what to learn next at every step, you're not doing research. If you feel like you're not sufficiently challenged by what you're doing now, _you_ are supposed to take the initiative to speed things up.  In other words, don't confuse a hands-off mentoring style with low standards. If the group in general is productive, does good science, and writes solid papers, then standards are what they're supposed to be. From your description, you are learning a lot of new things, starting a new experiment, finding out how research works, and overall describing a pretty excellent research experience.  "

If you are directly given menial tasks by your advisor, that you are not thinking for yourself and just repeating a motion, it may feel not challenging enough.  However, it sounds you are given a good amount of freedom. In that case, it could be that you are just not diving into the research itself.  > I noticed that the head also didn't like to be a mentor too much - that is, > he only liked to tell me what I needed to know for my task and nothing else, > leaving extra learning for myself. > > The problem with this is I'm left mentally starved.  To me, this sounds like you are looking for a challenging class, not research. You want someone to specify a problem and you work through it with them and studying the necessary topic until you can solve it. Otherwise, I do not see how self-learning/teaching and exploring how to solve a problem is not challenging enough.  My suggestion is to talk to your advisor after thinking about what your really looking for. Do you want self guided learning and research but your advisor is not allowing you to tackle challenging problems? If so, first prove you can do the easy ones she/he has given you, and then bring up your need to 'quench the mental thirst'.

I've tried to find a workaround, and fix my solution, but I've just found another thing that I've overlooked. So I've lost my enthusiasm and self-confidence.  However, my supervisor claims he found a completely different idea to solve the problem. He explained it to me, however it has some parts to be completed. So he wants me to write a manuscript about it and fill the gaps. However, I cannot find any motivation to do so. I am overwhelmed by the feelings of failure and anger.  I know that I should be working on my supervisor's idea, but I'm so distracted with the mistake I've made. How can I overcome my mistake, and start to work again?  UPDATE: A month later, we solved the problem :)  ",

        "answer_body": "  Perhaps I'm taking the OP too literally at his word, but my first inclination is to see it like this: an undergraduate tried his hand at research, had a predominantly negative experience, and now is not motivated to continue even though his advisor gave him something else to do. Well, there is one obvious answer: don't continue with your research if you don't want to. Whenever an undergraduate is doing mathematical research (TCS research counts), they are doing it for the purpose of getting a sense of whether they like it and want to continue with it more than any other purpose. So if you feel strongly enough that you don't like it, it may well be that in fact you achieved what you were supposed to achieve in a fundamentally deeper sense than the one you are feeling bad about. Most undergraduates doing mathematical research decide at some point that it is not really for them, at which point they stop.  To be honest, my experience with undergraduates doing mathematical research is that they are often rather fickle and flighty in their approach _when viewed through the lens of a professional researcher_. I have spent hours, days or more trying to give undergraduates the training they need to work on a problem that I've chosen for them, only to hear from them next week that they are now interested in something _entirely_ different, e.g. some pattern they saw in the numerical output of some code that they wrote. Whether that is disappointing depends entirely on my expectations. I now think that treating an undergraduate as a \"non-positive year graduate student\" is the wrong approach: in particular they should not be assigned a problem that one would expect an older student or researcher to spend several months working on. Certainly they should not be given a problem such that a failure to solve it -- or even a complete neglect of it -- will have a significant negative impact on their advisor or anyone else.  Circling back to the situation: I worry that the OP has been placed in a situation which is \"too serious\" for an undergraduate student. A little context is missing; e.g., the OP writes  > I have been working as an undergraduate researcher in theoretical computer > science for 7 months.  Does that just mean that you've been thinking about TCS for 7 months? Are you getting paid to do it? (Most undergraduates in the US are not paid for academic work they do during the academic year...but the OP may well not be in the US.) Are you getting paid as a sort of undergraduate research assistant to your advisor?  There are some nuances in the situation that make it hard for me to read. On the one hand, it's possible that your supervisor is doing a bang-up job: he gave you a problem that you were interested enough to work on for several months (already a successful undergraduate research experience, I claim). You claimed to solve a piece of it, which is nice for you but not necessarily something that needed to be written up. Then your advisor discovered that there actually was interest in what you had done, and was involved in the process of discovering a mistake in your writeup. After that happened twice, he stepped in by sketching an approach of his own. That sounds really supportive to me. (I'm sorry that you put a lot of work into a writeup that he didn't comment on in detail, but: I've been on both sides of that situation. It happens, too often, to good people.) On the other hand, if your advisor actually expects you to function as someone who can mostly carry him through achieving his own research goals: when it comes to _mathematical_ research, at least, that's very bad. At the most you have a short internship as a mathematical researcher: it's his career, and the burden of responsibility needs to fall on him in every way. If you are feeling bad because you think that you've derailed his own research plans or otherwise disappointed him: well, I think that's very poor behavior on his part.  To end, perhaps you should embrace the fickleness of undergraduate research. Not feeling excited about the project? Don't work on it... **for now**. If there is something else that interests you, anything else, look at that instead, and talk to your supervisor about that if you choose. It may well be that you could regain your positive feelings about TCS research by thinking about -- well, anything -- and when that occurs and/or some time has passed, you may actually enjoy returning to the problem and proposed solution your supervisor gave you. (A big secret: I am a real life research mathematician, and giving up on something that isn't going well _for a little while_ in order to regain enjoyment and confidence is something that I do very often. Sometimes there is exactly one hard problem that I want to chip away at for days, weeks and months at a time...but more often, there isn't, and sometimes I wonder a bit at how hard people who only work on one thing are actually working.) Or not, which (according to me!) is really okay.  Final word: don't do mathematical research if you don't enjoy it. Seriously.  **Added** : I am concerned that my \"final word\" is not being understood as I meant it. First of all, an equivalent version is \"If you don't enjoy mathematical research, then don't do mathematical research.\" Maybe this stops people from reading this as \"don't do mathematical research [plus other words]\"! Second, the statement has to be construed in a reasonable way, and in fact anyone who is doing mathematical research has to construe it in a reasonable way _for them_. Certainly I **don't** mean \"If you wake up one (or two, or three...) days and have negative feelings about mathematical research -- or if you have one (or two, or three...) setbacks in your mathematical research -- then you're not cut out for it; just stop now\"! What I mean is \"The main reason that people do mathematical research is because of the joy and sense of personal fulfillment it gives them -- not that it _always_ makes them happy and fulfilled, but that in choosing which of the many things to do with their life, this choice seems to make them more happy and fulfilled than the alternatives.\" There are extrinsic rewards to mathematical research as well -- if you are successful enough at it, you make more than enough money to survive, you have more control of your daily schedule than many other professionals, there are many opportunities for travel, and so forth -- but if you remove the intrinsic rewards, the extrinsic rewards don't stack up against other careers that a similarly talented, hard-working person could probably achieve. Also _not enjoying_ mathematics is not a failure and is not the same as being bad at it. It almost seems silly to have to say this out loud, but: the people who do mathematical research as a career are not the ones who in all the world are the most talented or most successful at mathematics -- they are the ones who are talented and successful enough to get paid to do it and who value the activity enough to devote their lives to it. Most undergraduates who do some mathematical research do not want to devote their lives to it. That's not a character flaw or an intellectual weakness on their parts: there are just a lot of other valuable things to do. Finally, I'm not saying \"Look, most undergraduates quit, so you'll probably quit.\" I'm saying \"Most undergraduates quit, so the _idea_ that you might quit should not be so horrific that you can't even contemplate it.\" All things in moderation: if you have a bad experience with something, taking a small break from it, reassessing your commitment to it, adjusting your practice of it to rekindle your joy are all reasonable, healthy responses. So is powering through the pain, sometimes. These are all good things for us to have in our repertoire.  "

        "answer_body": "  As an early-career mathematician, I have had this experience, more or less exactly, several times. I think I've solved a problem (or made good progress toward doing so) and I become proud and emotionally invested, only to show it to a mentor (first my PhD advisor, then my postdoc supervisor) who quickly points out a fatal flaw in my reasoning. Sometimes, he will propose a different and much better method. I completely get how demotivating this can be. After all, I would think, why am I even working on this project if my mentor could do it himself more quickly?  But you have to overcome these feelings. Here are some points of view that helped me do so:    * Trying things and failing is how we learn. There's a mathematical lesson here about why my techniques failed and my mentor's succeeded. There's also a lesson about how to do research: how to do sanity checks, how to avoid \"premature optimization,\" etc.    * My mentor is a professional researcher with decades of experience. Of course he can solve things more quickly than me. Even if it feels like my role is to work out the details of his ideas, I'm learning a lot by doing that. And these \"brilliant ideas\" are usually adapted from previously existing techniques anyway--it's more an experience gap than an intelligence gap.    * Experiences like this keep me humble, which comes in very handy when teaching people who understand less than I do.  I would encourage you to try to power through these feelings of inadequacy. Part of being a mature researcher is not being afraid of being wrong.  Having said all that, a good way to avoid situations like this is to keep the person you're working under more in the loop while you're doing the work, so that they can steer you away from dead ends. In your case, it wasn't necessarily your fault that your supervisor didn't devote much time to your project, but in the future you should try to get high-level feedback earlier in the process.  "

        "answer_body": "  Okay. I was in a well respected PhD program for two years, doing research, when I got sick, and now I've been sick for 3 years unable to do math. I'm won't say what your experiencing isn't real or unpleasant, but I'd like to suggest I have some perspective to offer you. A lot of it comes from realizing unhealthy emotional habits doing math that contributed to the stress that brought me to where I am now, unable to do math.  Fundamentally, I believe the healthiest way to approach mathematical research is to truly and deeply appreciate your ability to exercise your mental faculties, your ability to ponder interesting ideas, and your abilities to think of interesting questions. This is something like, \"Neat, summation by parts is a neat tool and it's neat how it can be used in all these sorts of problems and, wow, maybe it is useful in this problem in such-and-such a way,\" vs, \"Gosh, my attempt to use summation by parts fails to solve the problem. I suck.\"  This is different from successfully solving problems. That is a fine goal, but if you allow it to dominate how you relate to doing math research, you will be stressed out all the time unless you happen to be wildly and luckily successful.  I'm suggesting an attitude of humility. With this sort of an attitude, you can more easily accept what everyone else tells you, that failing and making mistakes is a big part of research. Of course it will happen to you. It happens to others too, though you don't get the inside scoop into their research lives. Certainly some people appear to never fail, and maybe some people really are that successful, but envy will only stress you out and make you feel depressed.  You need to practice this by expressing wonder or thankfulness for what you do understand. Here are some examples.  \"Wow. I actually do understand the problem statement!\"  \"Neat! People actually care about this problem, it impacts the world in some small way, and I get to participate in the community by thinking about it.\"  \"It's neat that I was able to use [this clever integration by parts trick] in an attempted argument.\"  \"I am thankful I have an opportunity to participate in the mathematical community and potentially write a paper.\"  \"[Anything you think it positive: i.e., something about your experience, your paper, etc., you'd rather have than not have, no matter how small or trivial.]\"  Fake it until you make it. If you think there is a modicum of merit in adopting the humble attitude, then you are being honest when you practice such thoughts.  The point is, if you approach things from a humbler perspective, the experience wasn't wasted even if you don't achieve your goal. And it really is a privilege to think about mathematics. If you find you cannot, not matter what you do, enjoy the process of thinking of mathematics and working through ideas on your own regardless of whether it is fruitful or not, then maybe it is true that research isn't your path.  I miss my days of research and have realized I love thinking about math on my own. Hope there's something useful here.  "

      "question_body": "  ## \"Prependum\" clarification:  Strictly speaking, the supervisor has no actual authority in this decision (I think)-- it is between myself and the course convenor. However, I feel that `overruling' my supervisor by appealing to the convenor is unprofessional, and would inevitably affect the working relationship. This could be very counterproductive, and make an extension somehow pointless without the willing agreement of my supervisor. More importantly, they are the only potential academic referee (who knows me well) for use in a PhD application.  * * *  I know there is a similar question [here](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/52244/should-universities- give-extra-time-or-related-accommodations-for-students-with), but I am looking for advice in my particular hairy circumstance.  * * *  ## The Issue  I am currently writing an Honours Thesis in an Australian university due in less than a month. Since the end of last year, I have suffered from severe depression (been to hospital; self-harm; seeing a psychiatrist; etc) and have made this known to the Honours convenor who has pre-approved any reasonable extension I might ask for.  The problem is with my thesis supervisor. They are highly averse to extending the project, as they are a very busy person. I understand this; it is not their responsibility. However, they also believe that obtaining an extension would be inequitable for other Honours students. I have made them fully aware of my condition, and stressed to them the magnitude of the impact it has on my studies. For instance, I (conservatively) estimated that I work less than half of the amount of time I would be able to if not afflicted. I also have had a meeting with them with several visible cuts on my arm.  Their response to my concerns is that regardless of my condition, I have made significant progress. They believe I am capable of obtaining a High Distinction with my current progress. It is apparent from their other comments that they do not understand what depression truly is (i.e. \"everyone gets nervous at the end of an Honours thesis\").  At this point, I feel very pressured by my supervisor into submitting my thesis on time, but I do not think this is fair. I think that regardless of their perception of my academic performance, I have had dramatically less opportunity than other students due to my severe condition. However, it seems that mental illness is so poorly understood in this situation that what I think is a reasonable and fair extension (i.e. 6 months onto a 6 month thesis) is probably never going to happen in my institution, despite my gathering of evidence over the last six months in the form of letters from a psychologist.  On one hand, I recognize that it's not fair to ask my supervisor to continue supervising for the duration of an extension (and neither do I think they will willingly). On the other hand, I have been open and clear about the possibility of this happening from the very beginning of my project, and I believe they are seriously wrong about what they deem equitable. Their claim that an extension would be inequitable makes it clear to me that they are judging my condition based on my academic performance rather than on the actual opportunity I have had.  * * *  ## The Question  I'm really unsure what to do in this situation and would appreciate advice. Here are options I've considered:    * **With the aid of my psychologist, push for a significant extension that I believe to be equitable.** This is problematic, as it is difficult even for me to judge how long that should be. Furthermore, my supervisor probably won't be available. If they are, they will be so reluctantly and perhaps begrudgingly.    * Concede to my supervisor's wish for me to finish on time, and possibly end up with ~HD anyway.    * Obtain a short extension (~1-2 months) and spend that time refining my thesis without the aid of my supervisor.

Even students who aren't depressed have difficulty accurately assessing the progress of their research and thesis. Your supervisor has a lot of confidence in you, and seems to think you're \"almost done\". I'm reading between the lines a bit, but it sounds like your supervisor is a good supervisor apart from being clueless about mental health.

My son has Tourette Syndrome, OCD, ADHD and anxiety. We had the experience last May that his accommodation for extra time to turn in assignments was suddenly and arbitrarily removed from his accommodation plan. Overnight, his anxiety went sky-high. He got so nervous about the turning in of the homework assignments, that he couldn't think straight any more.  Two weeks of this, and mercifully, the principal (director of the school) notified me that the teachers were going to continue to allow him to turn things in late, on an informal basis. As soon as I conveyed this to my son, he relaxed and started to be able to do good work again.  So, based on this experience, I would advise you to negotiate a reasonable extension, enough to take the edge off the anxiety. Of course, even with the extension, you will probably have some anxiety. But it would be best to keep your anxiety to where you can still function and do good work.  You may find that having the extension in place gives you the peace of mind you need, and you are able to complete your project without actually using the extension after all. You never know!  Work with your therapist during this time, to check whether a sense of perfectionism is perhaps getting in your way. This is something that I have seen in my son. I have seen him not turn in homework assignments because he had skipped a couple of the problems. You may want to share your draft with your therapist, in fact.  Regarding your concern about maintaining a good relationship with your thesis supervisor --  (a) What are your mid and long-range goals in terms of continued collaboration with this person? If you do not plan to continue the collaboration beyond the Honors Thesis, then it might be helpful for you to start detaching emotionally. Are there some other people in your life whose good opinion of you is important to you?  (b) The beauty of working with a Student Disability office is that they can help the professor understand what adjustments may be needed. I was glad to read that you are looking into Access & Inclusion. Please let us know what you find out. Also, try to find a support group for students, or people, with disabilities.  (c) Don't assume your supervisor noticed your injuries or understood them. Take the time to explain things to him or her. (In general, it is, in my opinion, better to explain your condition and how it affects your studies, with _words_ rather than by displaying your injuries. I'm not saying you have to use long-sleeved shirts. You don't have to hide injuries or scars. But at the same time I wouldn't want you to fall into exhibitionism. I wasn't sure from what you wrote, whether there might have been an element of this. Also, keep in mind that a person can have a handicapping condition, without there necessarily being any self-harm going on. In other words, please don't ever feel that you need to harm yourself in order to get people to take your difficulties seriously.)  (d) Don't take it personally if someone doesn't \"get\" it.  "

Unfortunately, this simple fact is only moderately compatible with project-based research funding, since funding agencies would like to know right now what you're going to discover in the next two years. Some funding agencies have a rather relaxed attitude in this matter: My late doctoral advisor used to begin every project progress report with the statement _\"We had promised to investigate A, but in the meantime our interests have changed, and so we've rather investigated B\"_ and he always got away with it, because the funding agency was only interested in the number of publications. But if a funding agency gets picky when comparing project proposals and progress reports, things become more difficult. In such cases, researchers are often tempted to simplify writing the progress reports by putting those problems into the project proposal for which they already have a rather good idea how to solve them, but no publication yet.

When I started out I was typically assigned a graduate student advisor who would let me work on their project or would work directly with me to propose another.  There is typically a lot of reading that you will do when first starting out, but not applying it directly to a project or research proposal after a month indicates that something needs to change.  I would first talk about these matters with someone who understands your supervisor (graduate student, postdocs etc.) to understand more about your supervisor's expectations. Then have a talk with your supervisor with your concerns (they are valid!). If your supervisor continues to not be helpful I would consider finding another. It's tough to start over, but it would be better in the long run if you can find a better lab that is more nurturing to your growth as a researcher.  "

I started looking for summer research programs at different universities throughout the US, and also found one in Switzerland, but some of them require a very high GPA. The reason why I want to participate in these types of programs, is because I truly want to make my research skills more versatile - I also believe that being exposed to different research projects, will help me on my own, current, research project.  I do not have the high GPA, but I have the stamina, ambition, and research experience that I believe it takes to complete such an intensive summer program. Should I still bother applying to them, is there any chance they will consider me?  I do not want to ask my research professor for letter of recommendation, when I know there is no possibility of me being accepted. For anyone who has participated in said summer research programs, what was your experience like? Do they really place such a strong emphasis on GPA, or do they take into consideration the work you did/have been doing in your lab?

Your reticence is understandable but you should take a deep breath and ask anyway. There is no one to be your manager and promoter -- other than you yourself.  Here's a trick that could help you perform that function more easily: imagine yourself ten years in the future mentoring, managing, promoting and recommending a student with your academic record and interests.

However, I would say the best way to ensure that your research proposal hasn't been investigated before is to get in contact with an expert in the field and ask him or her this.  Of course, you should investigate the topic thoroughly before approaching the expert. One tip to do this is by using a [citation index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_index). This enables you to track how a certain paper has been cited, meaning you can follow the trail and more effectevly find out what has been done. For example, if you have located an old seminal paper in your field, finding out which papers have referenced this one should give you a fair chanse of finding what you're looking for.  "

        "answer_body": "  As an undergraduate doing research, **your primary goal is to learn** and publishing is secondary. Of course, publishing your results and going through all the associated things for the first time is part of the learning. There is nothing fundamentally wrong with spending your undergraduate years rediscovering something. To bring up a particularly relevant example for today: Alan Turing was elected a fellow of King's College in 1935 (at the end of his undergrad) by proving the central limit theorem. He failed to notice that it was already proved in 1922. I am sure he learned a lot from it.  Of course, you have to be prepared to rediscover. If you are not it can be very discouraging. From a _person experience_ , when I was an undergrad preparing my first first-author paper for submission I ended up finding previous work that had shown almost the same results 3 years prior. I had spent a lot of time rediscovering the ideas and writing my paper and it was a pretty devastating blow. My supervisor's words of encouragement: \"Don't worry, at least we know we're on the right track\".  He was right, and I was able to learn a lot from the experience (eventually leading to other publications). The particular paper in question sat in the back of my filesystem for a while, but I returned to it 2 years later with fresh eyes to discover that it was not as derivative as I had originally judged it and even this paper ended up being published (with some modifications) at a conference.  Another adviser takes the idea of rediscovery even further. When we move into new territory on a project, he will suggest some directions knowing that the relevant theorems have been proved already. He will tell me: \"this result has been proven, but don't look it up, you will arrive at it on your own and then we will both be able to understand it better\". This approach works very well in math-like fields since you have the advantage of knowing what you are going after as true, but still get to experience all the joy of (re-)discovery and the lessons you learn along the way. Something that is often not obvious from just reading somebody else's paper.  As an undergrad, don't worry about accidentally working on something that has been done. Concentrate on learning as much as you can!  "

Maybe soeone starts very boldly thinking that they're the best researchers in the _world_ , but for sure everybody at some point realises that the field is populated by experts, who know a great deal of things in the area. So in the case of finding out others sharing your ideas, humbly try and learn from them; in the (exceptional) case of really finding out a new research avenue, humbly start collaborating with others because you won't make any difference to the field only working by yourself.  2) **similar ideas do not prevent you from engaging on the same topic** : this is very common, and I've seen it happening a lot of times. Researchers become depressed when they see that something similar to their ideas has been published already. I think that what happens there is that you find something related, and even if you did not do the work, tend to believe that you would have done _exactly_ the same steps. It's only when you engage directly with the problem that you discover that you would tackle it (slightly or vastly) differently: that gives you a lot of _potency_ in my opinion, and it's a very good exercise.

An apology which is given freely and by own initiative is worth by far the most.  If the offence repeats, you can assume it's not a gaffe. Now you could really insist on an apology, but in my experience, it shows more aplomb, and, in fact, is far more powerful, to then move towards acting coldly, aloof and professional.

In terms of graduate admissions, the most important impact of having done research is that it should involve you working closely with more senior academics, who will them be in a position to give you strong graduate school recommendations.  Whether the research you do as a undergraduate gets published or not, what is key is that your research supervisor (and possibly other senior people you may have worked with) will know you well enough to write you a strong recommendation. If your research was done under the supervision of a prominent, respected researcher, that person's letter will count for more. On the other hand, if your supervisor has a poor reputation (being known for shoddy or crackpot work, for example), their evaluation of your potential will be weighted less strongly by the people reading your application file. If the low quality of your publication is a consequence of having worked with a rather poor senior researcher, that is something of a cause for concern, although the best course of action is still probably to get the strongest letter you can from your supervisor, even so.

      "question_body": "  I was recently asked to train a new undergrad research assistant in the lab I work in. I was then told this new lab member is my assistant. He has no experience working in the lab before this, but I had been there for about a year before he came in. We have been working together for a few months now, but I am stuck.  I did have the chance to talk with him more, and he told me that he is only doing research to get a paper published. After all, if you complete research and do not get published, what is the point? I was a little bit taken back when I heard this, though not surprised. Of course almost every researcher dreams of being published, but me personally, I truly want to learn. I am not boasting and trying to make myself look better, but I personally believe my experience as a researcher will serve me well in my future career. If I do get published, all the better! I do strive to have enough data for publication, but I put my learning first.  After hearing this, my opinion of John changed, though I try very hard not to make it personal. I try very hard to focus on the research, and put all of my energy towards making my project successful. He always mentions to me how his schedule is very full, that he is always busy, but at the same time, I also struggle in giving him work to do. I do not want for him to take credit for something I did (in the long run), but I am afraid that because I may appear weak to him, this will most likely happen.  We had a meeting with our PI a few weeks back, and though John had mentioned to me he would be available for work that morning... once our meeting concluded, and several alarms later (that the professor subtly hinted his annoyance with the constant going off of his alarms), he mentioned to me that he has to get going. He gave me one idea that we could do to improve our project, but then as he walked away, said that his schedule is starting to become busy. I am busy too, I am overwhelmed sometimes, but I simply cannot stand the complaining anymore. I would like to tell him in a nice way, that if we are to work on this project together, he must put in the same amount of work that I do. However, the professor has mentioned he is to be my assistant, so I am not sure if he does have to put in as much work as I do?  I am really stuck on how to stand my ground and not appear weak, but at the same time, I do not want to be mean/a jerk. I am also wondering whether I am just putting John in a negative light because I see him as competition? Any thoughts?  ",

First, it's fine for different people to create a joint effort with different motives. As long as the motives move the main goal forward. In addition, just because he wanted to publish a paper does not imply that he does not value learning. If his saying made you assume that he is just on for a free ride, I think that can be too premature a conclusion.  Second, learn how to manage people. Don't expect them just to fit in perfectly with your schedule and work style. Set up ground rules, lay out tasks, and negotiate on the ways of reporting. A very good feature about this case is you know his Achilles' tendon (or hanging carrot if you're a glass half-full kind of person): Name on the publication. Lay out all the works or tasks or learning for him and demand him to complete them on an agreed time or his name will not be listed as an author, but in the acknowledgement. Be civil about it and listen to what he says.  Third, sort out your own conflict. First:  > How do I tell him to help out more without being rude?  And then:  > but at the same time, I also struggle in giving him work to do. I do not > want for him to take credit for something I did  Actually do you need an assistant or not? If yes, then make sure the terms are clear and he followed through. If he did, and ended up in the paper, he will eventually take some credits of yours AND you will also take some credits of his. This is what collaboration entails, at the end we have a general idea who did what, but it's inevitable to have some shared credit. If you're completely possessive about your work, and you think that he is taking advantage of you, then you should consider if you need an assistant or if you should decline this responsibility assigned by your supervisor.  Lastly, strengthen yourself up. Listen to this:  > I am afraid that because I may appear weak to him, this will most likely > happen.  What about you that is weak? Why do you just label yourself weak from the get go? Personality? Physique? French? The only thing you need to be stronger than him in this case is your knowledge in this project. All others are side matters and you should not place yourself in the victim seat. An effective manager does not have to have strong personality, he/she just need to be fair, just, and remain clear and open in communication.  Lastly lastly, you should also talk to your supervisor for advice and tips. Work on it to create a happier collaboration experience.  "

I suppose this is the first time you have an assistant and in that case, it seems fair to ask your PI what is the scope of tasks and the amount of time you are entitled to ask your 'assistant'.  I know that the amount of work/time really depends on your country/university/field/department and lab.  Your PI should be able to give you at least general guidelines and what it is the **minimum expected from an undergrad assistant in his lab**.  Then stick to it at first and see how things go.  BTW,    * Were you given an assistant for the sole purpose that you were too busy? OR   * This new research undergrad had to be trained and since you have taken care of it, you can now 'be paid back' by his work to compensate the time you had put in his training?  If you don't know you should also figure this out with your PI.  > I do not want for him to take credit for something I did (in the long run), > but I am afraid that because I may appear weak to him, this will most likely > happen. I am also wondering whether I am just putting [him] in a negative > light because I see him as competition?  This should not happen as long as you keep your PI 'in the loop' about what everyone has done.  Keep a log of everything he has done and the things you have done. In a matter of fact and professional way.  This is also good to find out what is the contribution of each author/co- author in the final paper.  It is a good practice to **keep your PI up-to-date by e-mails** (particularly if you have a busy PI) of the progression of the work. (CC everyone involved in those emails). Even if your PI doesn't really read these emails. The purpose, here, is **to keep track in a** more **formal way**.  * * *  **Speak with your \"assistant\"**  _He is busy, you are busy, everyone is busy._  There are several points to consider here:    * Is your assistant still studying?    * Is he ' _doing research_ ' in your lab as a full-time job? As a side?   * As a requirement of his curriculum?    * As to gain more experience for later so basically for free and his own volition?    * Is he earning some financial compensation or reputational one due to this position?  And same questions about yourself?  The way to handle this situation is going to depend on his and your situation.  In any case, you can **ask in advance how many hours per week he can give you and when** : even if he is very busy, he should be able to give that much information before hand. Make him then understand that not being able to keep his words on what he promised is very unprofessional.  However, do give him a bit of time to figure this out, he looks pretty disorganised to me, so he might need a couple of weeks before he can give you a proper figure.  > I also struggle in giving him work to do  That would help you to figure out what to give him. Particularly as you seem to do wet-lab work for me (chemistry I would guess if there are many alarms going off). It is hard to plan on the spot.  > I would like to tell him in a nice way, that if we are to work on this > project together, he must put in the same amount of work that I do.[...] but > I simply cannot stand the complaining anymore.  Depending on the amount of time he can give you, you should be able to tell him something like:  _OK, based on your schedule, you can only work 10h on this project per week, while I put 35h and X is putting y h., which means that would be only 2% of the total work per week and then I was working on this project from XX months and X,Y,Z from MM months. You do realise that won't be enough for a proper contribution to the paper_  The guy might be truly very busy and just didn't realise what he was committing himself to. You don't expect the same thing from an intern and an assistant. You don't expect the same amount of work from the technician and the PhD student either. They also won't have the same priority on the final authors list.  Try to keep in mind that he is unexperimented and maybe he doesn't realise what is the normal amount of work he should be doing. And maybe he is not fitted for it. What you think about his opinion about research is irrelevant to the problem; how much time he can spare is.  You should also **assess why he tends to trigger the alarms so often**. If it is because he doesn't apply the best practices, ask him to do so. Teach him again if necessary.  Safety matters are not a joke. These can also block you to land future positions.  (In a former lab I was working in, one of the post-doc was a real danger and wasn't carrying about anyone health and safety but himself; he created different bad accidents - at the end, he had to go to teach in one this 'after school' complementary school for high-schooler as nobody was allowing them in their lab anymore).  Alarms might be seen as a nuisance to some people, but in the long term (life long-term) there aren't.  * * *  **Speak with other people of the lab/department**  If you can't have a clear idea about what to do from your PI, look/discuss with the other people from the lab about **general politics** of the lab. No need to complain about your assistant to other as it might be perceived as unprofessional.  Just figure out what is an assistant suppose to do, and how you are supposed to manage them, if there was any other undergrad assistant, etc.  * * *  **About the publishing part** :  If you do science, it is sad to be the only one to know about something, so please consider publishing in any case. ;)  And when you are publishing a paper, everyone is not required (and most of the time they are not) to put the same amount of effort and time. However, the contribution of everyone should be clearly stated in the final paper.  As long as you communicate clearly with your PI, you will be fine.  "

If you're not a bit flighty you'll have trouble flitting properly, which is more dangerous: you don't want to spend years working on something and discover at the end that you don't like it at all (you want to spend much less time).  However, my answer concerned research, and your project doesn't sound like a research project. It sounds rather like a **reading project** , or in other words a (largely) independent learning experience. (For those who don't know, \"solving polynomials by radicals\" is an important topic in mathematics which received a definitive solution in the first half of the 19th century.) For a reading project, you do want to exert some care in choosing something that will be worth the reading.  So I think you should _definitely_ talk to the lecturer right away. He gave you a topic because you didn't have something in mind, now you have something in mind, so it's time to go back. However you should not be surprised to receive an explanation of why solving polynomials by radicals makes a better reading project than the Collatz Conjecture. In the former case, there is an absolutely central question in number theory and algebra, it has a great answer, and all the steps leading up to that answer are also highly central and important. In the latter case there is a rather isolated, curious open problem. It's elementary, innocuous and catchy, which combine to create the psychological impression that it can't be that hard...but it _is_ that hard. In particular I am struck by the statement  > I know that as a third year student I definitely do not possess the > capabilities of making any sort of impact on the conjecture[.]  To that I reply:  > I know that as someone with a PhD from Harvard who has successfully solved > some open problems in number theory that I _probably_ do not possess the > capabilities of making any sort of impact on the conjecture.  The point being that nobody does, so far as I know. If you think you want to tilt at windmills, it's a good time to check in again on what the assignment was. (This is not to say that you should stop thinking about the Collatz Problem altogether. Rather, if you like it, think about it in your spare time.)  I will end with a story. I taught an advanced undergraduate number theory course twice: [see here](http://alpha.math.uga.edu/~pete/numbertheory2009.html). Each time the course included a final project. I gave a lot of suggestions for these final projects, and so far as I can remember most students did follow up on one of my suggestions. Certainly that is true with the two best projects, which both led to other (novel!) work by those students later on. The first time I taught the course, a student told me that he wanted to write about what ancient Greeks knew and believed about perfect numbers. I told him honestly that I knew almost nothing about that and therefore couldn't be confident that there was much to say. He replied enthusiastically that there were many things: did I know for instance that the Greeks thought that there were no odd perfect numbers, that there were infinitely many even perfect numbers, and that the final digits in this infinite sequence always alternated between 6 and 8? Well, no, so I let him write on that topic. When I read his paper, I found...well, I have already told you everything I remember on the subject, but it turned out that I had made the wrong decision. Some topics are more fruitful than others.  "

(For instance, as a chemical engineer, I wouldn't put much stock in somebody doing sociology or clinical medical research, but somebody who had a background in research in applied mathematics or mechanical engineering would be potentially of interest.)  So, if you're going to go into an area of economics where your mathematical statistics background will be of benefit, I think that will (or at least _should_ ) be viewed favorably by an admissions committee.  That said, you will want to make sure that your research supervisor understands that you're applying to economics programs, and tailors her letter of recommendation accordingly. Also, if you have a lot of experience in a different field, you will need to make clear to the admissions committee why it is you want to pursue the new field.  "

Most admissions committees look at several criteria, which are often weighted, but none weighted so high as to dominate the whole decision. A strong showing in one category can offset a weaker showing in another. Among them are:    * Basic knowledge of the field: You demonstrate this by completing a Bachelor's Degree in the field or a related field, or presenting evidence that you will do so by the time you matriculate. For example, in your question you mention that you are majoring in economics and want to go to graduate school in economics. No conflicts there. If you were majoring in philosophy and wanted to pursue a Ph.D. in chemistry, you would be a harder sell. What constitutes a related field may vary, but I know that a B.S. in mathematics can get you into graduate programs in engineering.    * Academic ability: You demonstrate this through your grades in your courses, especially those relevant to the graduate program you want to enroll in, and through your scores on whatever standardized tests the program asks you to take before you apply.    * Research potential: You demonstrate this one of two ways. If you were lucky enough to publish your research as an undergraduate, then the committee can assess what you did directly. If not, then you need one or more letters of recommendation from someone who has supervised you in a research setting. The admissions committee wants evidence that you have certain qualities that make good researchers, regardless of discipline: curiosity, critical-thinking, creativity, strong work ethic, passion or drive, etc. A good research experience in another field is worth much more than a bad one in your own field.    * Communications skills: You demonstrate these through your personal statement (or essay or letter) that you must write. Spelling and grammar errors or worse writing problems in this document are more damning than a bad letter of recommendation!    * And as JeffE mentions in [his answer to a related question](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/958/priority-of-application-materials-for-admission-decision/961#961): **No Red Flags**  "

It seems that publishing something in this field requires more knowledge that is out of the scope of a undergraduate.    1. Do most of the EE undergraduate successful applicants have publications?

For many fields, experiments require large _chunks_ of time, and it can be easier to find those in the summer, when you don't have to worry about making it to your next French class or whatnot. Additionally, there are lots of summer-specific research opportunities, ranging from field work experience to REUs, which may mean more funding, and which often mean people are \"used\" to having undergrad researchers around in the summer months.   * School Year: In some disciplines, summer is also very busy. For example, one of my field's major conferences is in the summer, meaning I'll be both gone, and distracted before and after. For some fields, it's also prime field-work season, which means if you're in a lab or a theoretician, things might get a bit lonely. Similarly, people do like taking vacations in the summer. It's also often easier to work in \"Research for Class Credit\" during the school year.  > Also, if an undergrad does research during the school year, are they > expected to be as productive as someone working during the summer?

You should really talk to the professor to work it out.  I've noticed that professors will admit to being incredibly busy but often won't cut students slack unless something out of the ordinary has happened. But this is because (often times) they've hired a student to help precisely because they're too busy to do it. If they cut you slack, then their work won't get done.  If it's independent research - even if you're doing it for course credit - then I only recommend doing it during the school year if you're otherwise taking a relatively easy semester. Also make sure to plan to give yourself a break around midterms and final. If you want to write a final paper, get it done at least two weeks before finals.

Several times, I've had great conversations with undergraduates in which I point out that I'm thrilled that their experiment has failed, because now they can better understand what doing science is like, and they can pick themselves up, learn from what happened, and try again, and this is what makes them 'real' researchers.     2.

We had a manual, but not the required knowledge. When we got into that project I realized he needed circuit design people, and none of us had taken a circuits class. He knew circuits and I think he thought we did too. **Make yourself available to help.** People rarely admit when they struggle with stuff; **are you regularly checking in with them to make sure they're not in over their heads?** This gets critical they work on open-ended research where they don't have a hard deadline and they know someone else will pick up where they left off. They might get lost and figure the next person will figure it out.  Yeah, undergraduates get lazy. If we didn't suck at time management and had the drive almost everyone would graduate in four years, and plenty would graduate in three years. Your researchers 20-nothings surrounded by other 20-nothings. Not a recipe for responsibility. If they ghost on you, send them an email. Don't start with \"Why aren't you working?\" Start with \"How's the project? How are you?\" They might be buried or burned-out by the middle of the semester. Cut them some slack. They might be struggling with their classes and the research.  And make sure you got the right undergraduates. That probably sounds stupid, but the project I mentioned\u2014it sounds like I'm ragging on it, but I mostly enjoyed it\u2014I thought the professor brought me on to write the software. He needed people who knew Python, Matlab, and C++. He had his grad student write all the code, and me and the people I worked with did all the hands-on construction. I only wrote some Java code (a language I didn't know, and it took way too long for me to write a dozen lines of working code) and we didn't use it. By the middle of the project I didn't know why I was there.  "

        "answer_body": "  I've had very productive undergraduates helping my team with software development and data input for research projects.  As others have pointed out already, high productivity is not the main aim of the exercise. Obviously experienced professionals will almost always do the job much more quickly and accurately. I would even advise against focusing on productivity too much as I have seen situations where I had to completely rewrite some of the substandard code some trainees had written in a rush. You can't expect both quality and speed for high level tasks.  If the student can spend only little time on the project, I'd recommend sticking to simpler, narrowly scoped tasks which may be more repetitive and less creative but nevertheless valuable. That still requires preparation in defining the task and describing it very clearly.  Of course some students are more talented or motivated than others but I've realised that the more effort, regular face-to-face communication, early troubleshooting you put into it the better the results and the satisfaction for everyone.  Research projects can appear extremely specialised or even useless, particularly to non-experts eyes. Making sure they understand the whole picture, how your project fits into it and what their contribution helps you achieve is essential in giving them a meaningful and motivating sense of purpose, helping them make the right choices and think more broadly.  Trusting their sense of initiative and their ability to come up with their own solutions can also be rewarding. I've often seen students suggesting more efficient workflows and approaches or being critical about the system they have to work with. One advantage they have over you is that they are very close to what they produce and every scientist knows that this a privileged perspective from which new ideas can emerge. And having new ideas, for academics, is very productive.  "

      "question_body": "  I'm an undergrad student working at a large research hospital over the summer. My research has been making very good progress; my PI has implied that we are likely to ultimately publish it. My abstract was selected for a prestigious oral presentation (fewer than 10% of [not exclusively undergrad] students were selected), but something doesn't sit right with me about the authorship she suggested.  My PI added a few authors who never actually contributed, but she hoped would. At least one of them still hasn't. This didn't bother me but is starting to because a student who has put a lot of work in is being excluded.  This grad student conducted and scored the neuropsychological assessments for most of my participants, and those scores are key for my research question and results. The student works in a lab that collaborates closely with mine. I suggested that she should be given authorship, but my PI told me that she should not be. After sending my abstract to the list of collaborators, one of them even asked me why the grad student student was not asked to be an author.  Since this is a niche field that I likely want to work in, I am worried about creating resentment. I know that this is ultimately just a summer research project, but if it goes further and becomes published I would not feel right with my exclusion. It just doesn't sit right.  My question is two-fold:  (a) Is it worthwhile to ask that the student be given authorship? The PI of the other lab is notoriously abrasive, and I wonder if my PI wants to avoid giving her too many footholds in this project. I don't want to stick my head into institutional politics. Does this student even deserve authorship?  (b) How do I approach this subject with my PI? She is a very nice person and I don't usually feel intimidated by her, but I'm keenly aware of my position as an undergraduate researcher at the bottom of the academic ladder.  Thanks.  ",

The next objective would be then find a different PI who matches your ideals. Frankly, I don't know of many prospective PIs who would welcome rebels. You may have to endure quite a long cold war.

Plainly doing work does not qualify for being included on the authors list.  These things have to be dealt with between PI to PI. For sure the other PI was aware that the undergrad there was involved.  So there are a few points to consider    * Your PI does not like to include the other PIs student, since she knows the other PI want to be included as soon as the student is included.    * From the other PI's side it could be the same motivation, but the other way round.    * Authorship problem can have nasty consequences (read retraction watch) - maybe you have an ombudsman for scientific integrity issues at your institution    * The inclusion of people who did not contribute is something which some journals exclude explicitly, however, it is usual.

But for an industry job such as a software developer, the question will be \"Can you code?\" It is possible that a computer science graduate has a whole heap of academic accomplishments, yet has no idea how to write software (I have encountered such candidates).  One important point is: **tailor your CV to emphasize the right things for the field.**  For example, if you did a computer science project that involved writing some software to do something novel, and then published on it, you would highlight different things on your CV depending on the type of job you were going for.    * For academia, you would probably emphasize the novel methods and academic output.   * For industry, you may want to highlight the software development skills you employed.

This worked out quite well for me, but is not without it's pitfalls.    * First, yes, your professor should be able to support you in your research interests - the odds of what your interested in being so far afield from their expertise, when you're an undergrad, is fairly unlikely.   * That being said, there are two elements of support they won't have: infrastructure and funding. It's helpful, if you're working on a project, for there to be grad students and postdocs working on similar things. Code you can use. Helpful little suggestions like \"Have you read Smith's most recent paper in Journal of Important Things?\" That kind of ambient helpfulness isn't going to be there.

Depending on your institution, you usually need to have some form of a supervisor. If this is the case for you (it was for me) then you will need to find a researcher who is doing something close enough that they are prepared to take you under their wing. In my case, I was already working as an RA in a lab that was close enough, and my professor agreed to supervise me even though he though I would not get the results I expected. He gave me as much support as he could (including essential financial support!), and a lot of psychological support, but he gave me less _academic_ support than he would have had I been researching something fully within his field. Doing it without a supervisor at all is tough - a supervisor can mentor you, help you keep deadlines, and usually give you some methodological and theoretical support even if it is not exactly within his field. In my case my research was empirical, and so I needed the facilities that my professor could provide in order to run my experiment. However, I designed, built, ran and analysed my own thesis, because it was my idea, and I understood it better than my supervisor did. If I had questions I could turn to my professor or other researchers, but the work was fully my own. I am proud of that, even though it was tough. It was a similar story when i tried to publish - much of my paper was based on a field with which my professor was not acquainted, and so he was less able to help me with preparing the manuscript. It took a long time and two rounds of revisions, but finally I got my manuscript accepted for publication in a major journal. It feels good, even very good. I am proud of myself, and my supervisor is proud of me, and I don't regret it for a second.  That being said, my PhD is being done on a question that is much closer to my supervisor's heart.

In principle, you can propose to divide this money up however you like, but if you try to divide up the compensation among all the faculty members involved, it may not be enough money going to any single person to really be worthwhile.  As the PI of an REU site, I do not pay the other faculty supervisors anything. However, my field is not mathematics but physics. The faculty mentors, most of whom work in experiment but some of whom are theorists, would all be on campus doing research even if the REU students were not present. Most of them are getting paid summer salary off other research grants. The only direct faculty compensation goes to me, since I manage all the advertising, admissions, and logistics for the program, which really do amount to about a month of full time work. Some other programs have a PI and co-PI who share the responsibilities and compensation basically equally, but I would suggest not dividing the money up too finely.  "

      "question_body": "  I'm a fairly new Assistant Professor at a 4-year university. As is often the case our teaching load is high and we are also expected to do research. Personally, I like both teaching and doing research.    * The difficult part of it, however, is to attract the students to work in your lab (often on a voluntary basis) that will make it worth the time and effort needed to train them.    * The other challenge is this: once you have a student that you clearly see has the ability to perform well (both intellectually and skill-wise to work in a lab), how do I motivate them to spend as much time as they can in the lab?  It's obviously not worth it when a student starts an experiment and then loses the motivation to come in in-between classes to make a measurement. It's my feeling that the students see it like this: \"if I come in and do some work in the lab, then that's good and useful for the professor\", but without the true engagement to learn something from the experiment, without the student having the curiosity and passion to follow-up, it becomes more like waste of time and money.  Obviously, I realize that I'm asking a lot. It's generally accepted that this kind of behaviour/motivation can be expected from a Ph.D. student, but not so much from an undergrad. Nonetheless, this is the situation that many professors are in since they only get to work with undergrads and are still expected (and genuinely want) to do exciting research. If I could, I would spend much more time in the lab myself, but it's just not always possible.  ",

Because the PhD student is being paid to be there, and the undergraduate isn't.  ## The takeaway  Being an undergraduate is hard. You've got 4-5 classes, all of whom want you to work like that class is the only one you're taking. You are probably having to work to pay your way through school, and you are trying to have enough leisure time that you don't go insane.  Your best way to get them interested is to take away one of these stressors: pay them (so they don't have to work), give them course credit (so they can take less classes), or treat it like leisure (so they can do something they enjoy casually).

My internship is based in a Latino Studies Research Institute, and my research for the summer concerns using machine learning methods to statistically analyze possible correlations between race and socioeconomic status in certain Latino groups. This is my first time conducting research, and I'm a bit lost.  For example, my research advisor told me I'm looking into a new area of (which surprised me heavily) since nobody has ever approached that area in the way that I'm before. Basically, my research won't be heavily conclusive (I'm working with only a few hundred data-points, a threadbare amount).

I basically come in everyday and look for machine learning algorithms to better fit my data, along with more information for the qualitative aspects of my soon to be report. And for the most part, besides a research associate who is a statistician, I'm left to do the grunt work of looking up all the programming and statistical techniques for my project. Also, the professor that I was recommended to talk to isn't in the same field as me ( he's in Environmental Engineering ), so I don't know what to do from there.  So, I would like to know -  As a undergrad researcher whos conducting research in a field that is not my major, what is expected of me? I'm a Computer Engineering major in a Sociological/Ethnic Studies Research Institute.  How can I bring up issues to my adviser? Sometimes it feels like I'm being left out to do my own research. Every other intern seems to have somebody who our research adviser brought in to help them out specifically - e.g a intern doing Latin music has a musicology grad student to advise them , a intern doing migration patterns in Latin America has a sociology research associate to advise them, etc.  What should I do to stay with the institute? I really like what they are doing, and they seem to like the research that I'm doing, and do tend to hire people that are beneficial to them after they graduate college.

Work hard, communicate well. If they see potential in you, they will likely want to keep you.  And, be honest! If you like working there, say it.

In this arrangement, nothing changes except the compensation - in summer the work is paid, during the school year it is for credit.  Now, from what I have done and seen, people don't stick in the same lab longer than that ESPECIALLY if you are looking at grad school or medical school. This is because you need 2-3 PIs giving you a glowing reference.  That been said, I have taken a summer research project which I didn't continue (I.e. the length was 12 weeks). And I've done one research project which is 2 years (and still on-going). My third project was summer + school term in length.  * * *  In short, you should diversify your research experience in different labs. You can work as long as 12 months, and as short as 3 months in the same lab.  Though I don't know much about other universities, I expect this to be same or very similar at other universities. The time to learn basic skills will vary but 3 months should be a good start, of course as you do something longer you will get even better.

While I do not want to sound too greedy, I want to express my desire to work diligently as the lead author and aim for the tier 1 conference. I also feel the need to talk about this as soon as possible because the deadline for the submission of papers for the tier 1 conference is less than two months away.  I am not well informed of the culture of the academia, so I am not sure how to bring up these topics to my professor or if the topics themselves are too arrogant for me to mention. How should I approach him about these topics?

Some major fields of research don't even exist as undergraduate majors in most colleges (e.g., neuroscience), so it's understood that many students will come from different backgrounds.  The more similar your major is to the new topic, the easier the learning curve. If your major is significantly different you may want to take some post-bachelors undergraduate courses before beginning the PhD program to bring yourself up to speed.  "

What's more important is that you can explain the choices you've made. They will look at your research history in context of your PhD choice. You just have to make sure that it shows off the skills they want you to have to do the PhD, those skills are not really subject specific.  I did an undergraduate and masters in Physics and got offers from Oxford, Cambridge and CRUK among other less well known UK institutions to do PhDs in cancer research so it's definitely not essential to have experience before hand, but will also depend on how competitive your chosen field is.

        "answer_body": "  Yes, this is definitely possible.  When I was doing my undergraduate degree, I was pretty sure my interests lied within the area of nonlinear dynamics and systems of ODEs, and I had picked up some research experience in my third year as well as during my MMath dissertation. My third year summer project was on critical factors and tipping points (with application to a prey-predator population model) and my MMath dissertation was on nonlinear laser dynamics. However, I was finding towards the end of my undergraduate degree and the MMath project that I wanted to do something more rigorous, involving pure mathematical analysis and how this applies to partial differential equations (and I had taken some courses in fluid mechanics and PDEs beforehand). My current project is on statistical solutions of Navier-Stokes equations, which is a very different area to what I researched at undergraduate level. My ex-supervisor gave me vanilla advice, saying \"your PhD topic should be the same as your MMath project\" - in some sense this is true, because one piece of advice I've heard is that one should choose an area to specialise in as soon as possible, even though this may not suit everyone (and when applying for PhDs I was very unsure about the area of research I wanted to pursue, so I had offers to study a wide range of topics with varying mathematical backgrounds). I chose my current project because there would be opportunities to fill in the gaps from my previous university, the area of research is fairly lucrative, it would enable me to see things I had applied before in a new and rigorous light. I explained all this to my supervisor when I had my interview with her and admitted that my background of mathematical analysis wasn't as strong as it could be - but I emphasised that I was willing to learn and that the project in question would be one to help me become a better all-round mathematician. Subsequently I was accepted onto the project and (bar the usual PhD student woes) on the whole I am quite enjoying it as it's a completely different area to the ones my previous university offered. My background would imply that my strengths lied in numerical methods and applied nonlinear dynamics, and even though I would probably have much better luck at PhD programmes along the lines of these, I decided that I didn't want to spend my academic career simply \"number- crunching\" and doing stuff I found relatively straightforward. Doing more pure stuff is harder, but in my opinion, much more rewarding (as you can actually understand the background theory of why things are the way they are rather than just running a simulation and accepting that it works).  So to answer your question, if you apply to a PhD programme and explain your strengths and limitations of your background (be honest!) and explain why you would benefit from the programme, then that can be equally as important as knowing what the research itself is about I suppose. Some people may not advise making the change of topic, but if your heart is set on it, then grab the opportunity while you can.  "

        "answer_body": "  Some universities and faculty are more interested in getting undergraduates involved in research than others. I've had quite a few undergraduate students do research with me with great success (publications even). I've never taught at a university with a PhD in CS though - my institutions encouraged undergraduate research and often even provided funding for it.  I would recommend against approaching PhD students to work on their research unless directed to do so by their advisor - they are focusing their time and energy on finishing their degrees as well as any research/teaching duties assigned by the university. You can ask graduate students for advice on which professors are interested in working with undergraduates - they usually know the faculty pretty well.  As far as professors, there are a few different approaches. Your department should have research seminars - probably more than one - have you been attending? They are usually open to anyone who is interested and it's a good way to hear about interesting research. If the faculty member you are interested in working with has a research group with a seminar series then sitting in on that is also a good way to show that you're serious about doing research with them (but ask if that's ok!). Figure out a specific faculty member or research group you're interested in - you're more likely to get a positive response if you can demonstrate knowledge of what they are doing and genuine interest (in the research - not just in getting a recommendation letter!).  Does your department have programs for undergraduate research? Many have summer scholar programs that partner students with faculty or with research labs. Faculty who have grant money can often get extra funding to pay an undergraduate to work with them.  The other thing you can do is to look into Research Experience for Undergraduate programs - summer programs where you'd go to another university to do research. They are competitive to get into though so it's another situation where you'll need a letter of reference. This can be from someone whose class you've taken (I've written them for my students).  "

      "question_body": "  I am an undergraduate student in mathematics, and I will be starting my third year of university in the fall. I recently attended an NSF \"Research Experiences for Undergraduates\" (REU) program.  Unfortunately, the program did not go well for me. I can't engage with the material at the proper level, and I've accomplished very little while I've been here. For reference, the others here are writing multipage papers about things they've done or at the very least, learned, and some plan to submit theirs journals or present their findings at undergraduate-friendly conferences. I could probably write a paragraph of what I \"learned\" but in my opinion, I don't have enough background to even coherently think about what I was supposed to accomplish.  Here's a rundown of other possible reasons that I performed poorly:    * As I said before I don't have much background. I've taken all of the pure math courses my school offers, but the others here came in knowing things like category theory, algebraic geometry, etc. that I simply haven't been able to learn well in my short time here. Notably, the program website never indicated that I would expected to know that stuff. I certainly exceeded the \"minimum\" requirements to apply.    * My research advisor is advising three students and we're sharing projects. Since the others knew so much more than me, I feel like he was unwilling to help me with things that was probably trivial to others. (I know that in graduate school that attitude from professors might be common, but the other students had semester long classes on things I was trying to pick up in a few days.) This was also his first experience involving undergraduates with research.     * While my program is considered competitive in the sense that they apparently get 300+ applications only accept 9 - 12 students each summer, I'm pretty certain that I only got in because I'm a member of an \"under represented group\" in mathematics and the program tries to favor such individuals. I was clearly not accepted on merit based on the caliber of the other students.   I am concerned about my performance because these programs are \"designed to expose undergraduate math students to research to the extent that they are encouraged to attend graduate school in the mathematical sciences\". Considering this experience makes me want to do anything but graduate school in math, I'm worried. Should I let this experience be a wake up call?  ",

Everyone starts out as a poor researcher. Becoming a good researcher requires hard work, preparation, and some chance. It is pretty clear you do not have the preparation yet. If you have taken all the pure math classes at your home institution, this suggests that your home institution may not be able to prepare you for math research.  It's a personal decision to pursue research. If you decide to do that, you should talk to your advisors at both the REU and your home institution about what you need to change to be better prepared.

        "answer_body": "  To address the titular question, no, being a \"poor undergraduate researcher\" does not mean you are not cut out for graduate school. First, many people who go to grad school in math have no research experience in advance. Second, having one bad research experience does not mean you are a poor researcher-- you're not even in your third year yet.  Having bad research experiences is pretty common, and I know several professional mathematicians who've had bad experiences. I was part of a summer program and a workshop where I felt I was in over my head and everyone else seemed to know the topic much more than me. Fortunately they weren't my first research experiences, and they didn't last as long as an REU, so they weren't too discouraging as a result. These experiences also provided no gauge as to whether or not I could be a successful researcher.  Research takes a lot of time, usually more than you expect (even when you expect it's more than you expect), as well as adequate preparation. It's also hard to find good problems that are suitable for undergraduates to do in 6-10 weeks. Part of the problem is, before you work on a project, you don't know how hard it will be or exactly what it will involve. Therefore lots of REU projects don't amount what was hoped for. It sounds a least like this project wasn't appropriate for you at that time. Whether that was due to the supervisor being too ambitious or you not having the expected background, I can't say. (There could be other reasons for your admission besides your \"minority status.\") What I can say is that is easy to get the impression that everyone around you understands or knows more than you just because they're more vocal or they know _different_ things from you.  To address what seems to be your principal concern now, the primary reason to go to grad school in math should be because you want to learn and do more math. Getting a master's or a PhD in math does not mean you will be a math researcher, and you often don't even need to do any research to get a master's. It's unfortunate if this experience turned you off from math, but I suggest you wait a little while to see how you feel about math. Maybe after this experience fades from your memory, you'll get more excited about math again. Or maybe you'll find something else that excites you, which is good too.  By the way, if you've already taken all the math classes offered at your school by your second year, then possibly your school doesn't have an environment as conducive to developing mathematical maturity as other schools. If you do want to pursue math further, you might look into transferring, a semester abroad, or taking classes at other nearby schools.  "

You might object that if an undergrad did research that was strong enough, it really would serve as evidence that they will succeed in graduate school.

        "answer_body": "  As somebody who runs an REU program, I would say that the answer is generally no, we probably cannot accommodate a student who wants to start late. There are a number of reasons for this. First, missing the first few weeks of a program deprives a participant of a significant part of the research experience. The first week of my program has a lot of orientation activities for the students. They get to learn about the campus, tour the various labs that all of them will be working in, and take safety training classes. It is not so easy to replace these for a student who arrives late.  There is also the research time that is lost if a student arrives late. I would generally prefer to offer a space in the program to a student who can attend the whole program and thus get maximum benefit from it. Because of my university's schedule, all our REU programs start quite early. The programs have already started as I write this in the last week of May. Yet we do not have difficulty finding enough well qualified applicants, and I would not like to offer a space in my program to a student who will not be able to get the full benefit of participation.  The second major reason for not allowing students to start late is that is may simply not be permitted by the terms under which the REU program is funded. Most REU sites are funded by the National Science Foundation, which has strict rules for how funds are supposed to be used. The terms of my grant from the NSF specify how many students we will support, and (approximately) how long they will be part of the program. Deviating from these parameters could imperil future funding for the REU program.  We did once have a student who had an emergency that prevented him from getting to campus for the first week of the program, and we made allowances, but this was an exceptional case.  "

You should inform whoever is running the REU about your situation once you are accepted to check if starting late will be OK, however. There are also several REUs that start reasonably late, maybe the first or second week of June, so that a student on the quarter system should not have to miss more than a week.  "

You need to do a bit of design and planning about the project and research idea that you want to implement. Then you may divide the work among students based on their strengths and weaknesses. You may assign one group to the whole project and assign individual modules to the students or you may create many groups and each group an individual module. Once this phase of project is over, you will be able to assess the students by their research caliber and motivate the good students for further work, which may be another project with more intensity. In addition to this, you can motivate them to go to better universities and industries for project work. This will really broaden their outlook. They will start looking beyond getting some CGPA and grabbing a job. I hope I could give you some idea :P  "

For the corresponding assignments the students are asked to speed up a slow program given to them. Their score on those assignments depends on the speedup they are able to get, and -- here's the kicker -- if they can beat the performance of my solution they get a 20% bonus. I've seen students explore exotic data structures and algorithms, figure out how to embed hand-tuned assembly code, and teach themselves how to write multi-threaded code, just so they can say they beat the instructor. It's really terrific watching them push themselves to excel.  Your situation is almost certainly different from mine, but I think it's still fair to say that students will self-engage, and push themselves to think creatively and explore different solutions, if the motivation to excel is coming from the inside -- which is really what research is all about.

        "answer_body": "  As you stated, the lack of research experience is a problem. When your application is being reviewed, above all, the committee will be looking for evidence that you will be able to perform impactful, independant research.  The specifics of your industry experience and design projects will vary how much you can 'leverage' them. Your good grades, while helpful in demonstrating your engineering knowledge and dedication, do not provide much beyond that. If, in your industry or design projects, you had to investigate or solve a problem, I would try to emphasize them in your statement of purpose/personal statement. A specific example where you experimentally solved something could do you a lot of good.  I would not discount your research at a lab even if it was outside your field. It is direct evidence that you can perform such after all. Depending upon when you performed this research, it could even form a logical flow of why you are choosing to pursue a PhD (had the first structured experience of research at (x) but field wasn't a good fit because of (x), had several chances to do applied engineering work which was great because of (x) but was constrained and lacked (research), combined = PhD in engineering).  As the next typical round of applications will be this fall, it looks like you may have a summer to fill in some of this gap. It is critical that, if at all possible, you find a research position in engineering or a related field for these couple months. It would be difficult to justify how interested you are in research and a PhD if you used your time to take another typical industry internship.  As for your last statement, you are obviously a weaker candidate because you have less evidence of your ability to do research. I certainly wouldn't call you an outsider, however, and industry experience, especially for an engineering student, is not uncommon. Funding will be highly dependant upon the university and your eventual advisor. Some provide departmental funding for the first year, giving you a chance to find an advisor after admittance and for one or both of you to secure a fellowship/grant. Some are fully funded. Some are much more dependant on pre-admittance contact and an interested potential advisor with an existing grant. I don't see how your work history would affect the issue of funding any differently than it would your admission process.  "

I don't know how you're presenting your work, but if it's anything like this question, that might play a significant role.  What I mean to say is this. You did not explain your situation very well. Sure, I got the idea, but this is a relatively mundane situation, \"Nobody will pay attention to me.\" It's just not _communicated clearly_ (or professionally, do you really need to abbreviate _department_?), as I've pointed out that it's not even clear what question you're asking.  But when it comes to actual scientific research, we leave the world of the mundane. You are potentially discovering something nobody has seen before, or at least working on very technical material. Anyone reading your work or listening to you cannot simply fill in the gaps or correct any imprecision. If they could, it is overwhelmingly likely _not_ 'research' in the academic sense of discovering or clarifying things that are new to the world, not just you.  My point is supported by your posts on MSE about Brocard's Conjecture (see, for example, [here](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1231576/an- argument-for-brocards-problem-has-finite-solution)). You used very unusual notation, lots of handwaving, and were generally unable to explain yourself sufficiently, by mathematical standards, in the body of the post or in the comments.  If you are asking faculty members to comment on work that's presented similarly, dismissal seems like a likely outcome. The flaws above are so serious that I can only assume (in that example) you hadn't made any real progress on Brocard's Conjecture, and thus it wasn't really worth my time to continue attempting to make sense of what you had presented.  You need to sit down and ask yourself some serious questions about what you have produced and how it's presented. Questions like \"Is this true? How can I tell? Is my argument correct beyond a shadow of a doubt, and has it been tested on several examples? Have I made any conclusions that simply don't follow, or used leaps of logical faith to justify anything? Have I explained things so that, with minimal effort, this can be read and understood by a professional?\"  "

Any well- written discussion that demonstrates significant understanding of the research area is probably satisfactory. A doctoral dissertation is supposed to demonstrate significant research skill and the ability to perform cutting-edge research. A master's thesis is supposed to demonstrate the ability to perform some useful research in the subject area. An undergraduate thesis is supposed to demonstrate that a student knows something worth knowing about a topic, and original results are not generally a requirement.  In a way, it is good that you are unhappy with your undergraduate honors thesis. That demonstrates that you know what you have actually accomplished and also clearly understand the weaknesses of your work. It may be unfortunate that you have not had enough time to complete all the work you would have liked to complete, but if you continue along an academic career path, you will get ample opportunities to pursue more complete research projects.  (As a personal note, I should add that as I am writing this comment, I really ought to be providing comments on the thesis draft that I received the other day from my own honors college student. This is a really good student, and he has already appeared as an author on a paper in a top journal, based on his work over the past year. On the other hand, his written thesis is lacking in both contextualization and descriptive detail. To bring his work up to the level where I would like it to be would be a significant undertaking, and it is probably not going to get to that level in the limited time we have. To some extent, that leaves me disappointed, but I do not want to lose track of the fact that this is a really first-rate student, and what he has produced--- imperfect as it is---is quite remarkable for an twenty-one-year-old undergraduate.)

Internship advisors' letters from places like NASA centers were key points in some of my peers' applications in the past; 10 weeks is a good amount of time to show someone what you can do, although a longer relationship (stay in touch, etc.) certainly helps them understand your depths.  I'm not sure as to how much any particular program might value a diversity in your letters, but your professors at your school benefit from having their students do well; your REU advisors benefit too, but on fewer levels, which may make a letter from an out-of-school research advisor weigh a little more heavily.

Of course there are shallow implementation and verification jobs, but there are also plenty of engineering jobs about R&D fiddling and finding clever designs and solutions, and then there are also (purely) academic jobs in engineering fields. Note that the boundaries between all of these are very much blurred and there is a variety of people in engineering ranging from hands-on tinkerers to purist mathematicians with completely different mindsets. Therefore, people in engineering hardly ever agree on whether some job or result is just derivative craft lacking conceptual contribution, useful high-level research, or disconnected theoretical work with pretentious notation but possibly useless and not much behind it. Also, implementation jobs can require a lot of clever thinking too, e.g. in analog electronics or large system integration.  Since you're at the undergraduate level still, I'd say it's totally normal to learn and follow preexisting ideas before engaging in great abstraction and developing your own branches. It's hard to make strong and novel conceptual contributions to your field if you don't know its basics. Do not underestimate the work put in by many, many very intelligent people before you (one tends to forget about this at times, e.g. when reading a bad introductory book) and rather try to gather their insights and grow from them.  About your problem at hand: I guess the best thing you could do, as far as that is possible in your environment, is trying to steer your next career choices in the direction of institutions and companies that value conceptual thinking and smart solutions and not only dull implementation workforce. Aim for courses, texts, project topics, internships, and contacts that push you more and more in this direction.  "

But in general, yes, she can do this (all personal ethics aside). Assuming she does not use any substantial part of what you wrote, it is not plagiarism. As a student project, your work is generally considered like that of an RA (again, this is legally, not morally), so you have no requirement to be listed as an author of the paper. Assuming, of course, that anything you wrote is not being used in the publication.  My recommendation would be to try and discuss it with your previous advisor, and if they are not willing to discuss it, or you cannot reach an agreement, ask your advisor if they will get the chair of the department to mediate (she'll be less offended than if you just go over her head). If she says no to that, discuss it with the chair yourself. But be clear on exactly what you want to get out of it. Whether that's a chance to write it yourself (which doesn't legally make you first author as a warning), or merely inclusion as an author on any final publication.

        "answer_body": "  If you are the original author, you have authorship rights and your advisor cannot take that away from you. The worst that she can do is refuse to coauthor with you and take her own name off the paper, not yours, although if she did that, you should remove her contributions from the paper.  At your school, there should be a number of people who will advocate on your behalf, and I would start there. The dean of students and the department secretary are usually good first stops. If that fails, you could consider going to the school dean, the provost, or conceivably even the university president (although if it got that far, you are likely in the wrong or have a terrible program). If your advisor publishes without you as a co-author, you can seek redress with the editor of the journal where she publishes.  If you already know that this is an issue, you need to start getting your \"ducks in a row.\" A first step would be to 'publish' your paper as a working paper somewhere. Where you do that is going to be discipline specific, but SSRN is a good choice if you are in the social sciences, and Academia.com has this ability as well. If you do that, make sure you give appropriate credit, too. Two wrongs don't make a right, as they say.  Try to ensure that as many people as possible can attest that the idea is yours, and if you still have the original graded by the professor make digital copies, preserve the original at all costs. In the end, you don't want it to be your word against hers, and the more evidence and witnesses you have, the better. Rightly or wrongly, other faculty are more valuable than students, so show it to as many faculty as possible.  A few words of warning.    1. What you are talking about is plagiarism, and could even be intellectual property theft. **Universities take this very seriously, and it can end careers** \u2014both yours and your advisor's. Consequently, things can get very dicey very quickly. Be absolutely certain before you start making claims publicly that you are in the right: talk to someone you trust outside the department and outside the discipline and show them your work with the work you are doing jointly with your advisor; verify your sources; know your allies. Once this goes beyond you and your advisor, and perhaps a small cadre in the department, it is the intellectual equivalent of going to war.   2. **Be prepared to come to the table.** If this isn't published yet, then there is still hope for a negotiated solution. Know what your objectives are, and use your position to get those objectives, and don't get hung up on abstracts. For example, if you are really hoping to get into law school, then being author may not be as helpful as something else, and be prepared to accept that something else. Make no mistake, what I am talking about is corruption, but as an undergraduate, it is highly unlikely to be worth hanging yourself out to dry over something like this, if there is a negotiated compromise. On the other hand, if you are hoping for a PhD and a career in the field, then authorship can be crucial, and you may need to go to the mat over this so as not to be seen as a pushover or a flake in the future.   3. **Don't get caught up in office politics.** If your advisor has enemies, and she likely does\u2014especially if this is typical of her treatment of others\u2014departmental enemies will likely try to use you as a weapon to get to her. While it may be gratifying to do so at first, if you let that happen your interests will fall by the wayside as the whole issue becomes about whatever stupid issue is driving the office politics, and not about your intellectual and students rights.   4. **Don't get steamrolled, but don't overstate your contribution.** This is hard as an undergraduate, because you definitely don't have as much information about the discipline as your advisor, and it can be tempting to think \"My idea changed the world!\" whereas it is only a minor contribution. Know what you have done, and don't get pushed off that, but being seen as someone who is self aggrandizing or consistently over-estimates their own importance will hurt your cause. There are already people who devalue contributions because of who the contributor is, and you don't need to give them any ammunition, or give your potential allies pause because they are unsure of the reliability of your perceptions.

Find the sessions that cover topics of interest to you. If the conference has multiple parallel sessions (tracks), make a plan of which sessions you'll attend.  For sessions you plan to attend,    * Read up on the general topic of the session, to get a sense of what the important problems are in that area.   * Skim the papers that will be presented in the session, with the goal of understanding what kind of work is being presented in the session. Try to extract the main idea from each paper, and understand why it is an interesting and worthwhile contribution to the literature. (Don't worry about not understanding a lot of it.)  Does the conference have any panels scheduled? These are a good way to find out about interesting topics in a more informal and interactive way.  Plan to be an active participant, not just a passive listener. Is there a poster session? Poster sessions are great because they're designed for attendees to talk to participants about their research. Go to coffee breaks and lunches, and find some nice grad students (or other researchers) to chat with about their work. If you are having an interesting conversation and the coffee break ends, don't worry about missing a talk you were planning on attending - the ideas shared in hallway conversations are much more useful than the actual talks at the conference.

It took a while for me to understand how conferences (at least in theoretical computer science) work. I speak from my experiences in attending top-tier theoretical conferences. It may vary in your case. But in short: most of what you'll learn will be outside of the talks.  To set your expectations right:    1. Don't expect to understand a lot from the talks. Reading those papers in advance might be even more boring unless you are already familiar with the background, or at least the starting assumptions, of the presented works. Seasoned researchers have a good idea of results being presented, i.e. the exact formal claim, and they attend the talks just to get a rough picture of the proof and techniques involved. It's like intellectual networking. Get an idea of who has done what and how. Maybe it's useful later.   2. Asking questions during the talks will be intimidating. As a rule, I always hold my questions for until a couple of slides later. It is always good keep abstracting the ideas presented, and not worry about the details. Details often don't get in the way of getting a rough picture, which is essentially what the talks are for.  Now, ideas for making the most from your attendance. In short: you are charting the territory of your future research, and getting to know the leaders and active researchers in that field.    1. There are always researchers who have a reputation for nice talks. Make sure you attend their talks. Sometimes, all you learn is _how_ to give a good talk. Which is not to be underestimated.   2. Go with at least some interest area in mind. Make a rough plan of talks you'll go to. Reach out to presenters during coffee and lunch breaks. Just chat them up. Really. Everyone is waiting to distribute pearls of their wisdom and are happy for dedicated audience. Even better if your professor can help you identify his peers or their students in advance. Go up to them and convey your prof's greetings. Ask how they got to doing what they're doing.   3. Make friends among other research groups. Hang out with other (also senior) students. Learn about their work. Grab a few drinks together. It's quite likely you'll see them again and even collaborate.  I don't think you first conference would be about gaining deep technical understanding about anything. You would have succeeded if you could remember at least as much as you do after a visit to a museum. This visit will be about learning how the community works, who's who, and what beer tastes like in that city.  "

First off, determine the general term for the area of your thesis, for example, \"civil engineering\" or \"genetics\".   2. Create a word document (literature review) where you keep track of citations and books you have read in this topic.   3. Perform a \"Google Scholar\" Search for your topic, add list of citations to your literature review as you save each article and print to keep in a notebook. In addition, add a 'review' of each journal article you read including Summary, Main Hypothesis, Strengths/Weaknesses and Date Reviewed.   4. On Google Scholar, you can see what other articles have cited the article you are reading. This is a great way to gain further resources for your search.   5. Do this every day for a few weeks and you will be sufficiently immersed to have a background in the previous work to understand your thesis topic and background.  Additional Tips: When performing research, it's important to begin focusing on what new insights, methods or understanding you can bring to this field of study. In many ways, academia is a 'competition' where the winners are rewarded for their efforts with additional funding, facilities, and prestige. By performing background research (aka Literature Review), you are able to learn from the hard work and progress of others, and expand on their insights in order to 'make a better mousetrap'.  "

You gain more understanding with experience, but even professors find it hard to understand papers outside their own specialisation(s). They are not very different from you when it comes to understanding a subject quite foreign to them. The problem with research papers is that they omit background information which is well-known to specialists working in the same field, but almost always unknown to those outside the field.  Nevertheless, some papers may be more accessible than others. In my field (engineering), review papers are usually more accessible than regular papers. Review papers give you a taste of the state of the art without necessarily going into the technical details, and you will get an idea of the most important literatures and possible future research directions on the subject. The problem might be in identifying which research papers are review papers, because while some of them are published in review journals (close to my field this would be _Annual Reviews of Fluid Mechanics_ , for example), some are published in regular journals, and they don't necessarily carry the word 'review' in their titles. Asking PhD students in your department may help.  When reading regular research papers, it is a good idea to read the abstract, introduction, and conclusion first before reading anything else.  Reading recently published PhD or Master's theses is also a good idea, as they are usually more accessible than the more condensed form of research papers.  Finally, popular science magazines and talks or research bulletins published by research institutes but tailored for the general public might be useful if you want to know what topics are current and who are the researchers active in those areas.

The first comes from within - what you are most motivated and passionate to research, giving you a strong pull factor in that direction. Alternatively, some topics you will find totally and utterly boring, and there is a strong push factor there. When you are young, it can feel like this force is the only force guiding your learning, since you pick your elective modules, you choose which Wikipedia articles to read, etc. This is probably why you feel that choosing a good topic is going to be really important going forwards.  The second force comes from academia itself. Some topics are \"sexy\" and funding opens up for those topics, pulling researchers in. Other topics go out of fashion, pushing researchers away. This force is created by the hundreds of thousands of people working and funding academic research right now, and is totally out of your control. The significance of this force grows as you mature through your academic career, so while right now you probably barely feel it (beyond the fact that the electives you can choose from are decided by academics), in the future you will be acutely aware of it and how much of an influence it has on your research area. If you ever listen to someone accomplished explain their academic career path, they'll always tell you it was \"unusual\" because they started in X and ended up doing Y. \"Unusual\" career paths are so common place that these days i'd only be surprised if someone said they started working on X when they were 25 and now at 60 their still working on X. _That_ would be unusual. Of the hundreds of researchers I have ever met, I can only think of 2 or 3 people like that.  So long story short, I wouldn't bother researching around to find other topics you _may or may not_ be interested in, because it simply doesn't work like that - particularly in practical/applied Physics or life sciences. You will get funding and find mentors only in the topics society/academia finds most important. To go against the flow in this regard early on is to commit career suicide, since everything you do will be that much harder. No mentors, no funding, no one wants to accept your poster presentation, no one wants to publish your paper, no one asks you to review anything, etc. So from that point of view, if you want to make smart early-career decisions, look at new/expanding areas of research and find a way to make it your own. Learn to enjoy it because you are the best at it and you are energized by the progress you make, not necessarily the subject matter itself. Keep the things you love as hobbies, or save them until tenure :)  "

There are some ways to overcome this at various stages of your pre-graduate and post-graduate career.    1. Volunteer in a physics lab, a related engineering lab, or even expand your search to tangential fields like biophysics and even math. The point is to get you exposure to an actual research environment. You might look up questions related to picking a good lab to get experience as an undergraduate, and how to land a spot. Many undergraduate programs maintain websites where professors post openings in their labs.   2. Find a mentor, for instance one of your physics professors. Let them know that you are interested in pursuing this as a graduate student, but that you feel you do not know where to begin. Many people will be very accommodating. If you join a research lab (point 1), your advisor there can also serve this function. They can help break down research papers, assuming you've made a good attempt on your own.   3. Take seminar classes where you review research papers under the guidance of a professor and/or teaching assistant. This would be an excellent place to ask very basic questions and get a solid foundation.   4. If you are like me, maybe you will graduate with slightly too little experience/knowledge and decide to work full time as a technician or assistant in a lab for one to a few years. This can actually be a good setting to see what it is like to have to get up and commit a whole day to research for an extended period of time, in spite of failure, in spite of crummy co-workers, or whatever the situation might be. Many graduate students who come straight from undergrad go through a difficult period of acclimating to full-time research, which can often mean quite a bit more than 40 hours/week. You will also get to see how academic research labs work or do not work. As a technician I spoke to all the surrounding labs to learn about their research and get a sense for how their labs worked as small businesses. For some people, doing this cements their interest in graduate school, and for others, they recognize that it might not be a good fit for them, or maybe they decide to go to graduate school for something else.  In the end, like fish in the sea, there are more research topics that would interest you than you could possibly pursue in one lifetime. Thus, the point is often just to find one that suits you and pursue it fully. Then there are the techniques that you use. As you gain experience, you will find that even within one field, there are different techniques for studying the same thing, and maybe you prefer that over something else. I like applying machine learning and high performance computing to my research questions because it intrinsically interests me, gives me options for work outside of academia, and has not been applied much in my subfield, which limits chances of getting \"scooped,\" but did not figure this out until my second year in graduate school.  I also found out that I really like hardware programming, DAQ, and design work, but had no background before graduate school. Thus, graduate school is also a place where you learn about yourself, and you do not necessarily need to have all of the answers - just enough to be dangerous. You can enter with an open mind because it is mostly a learning experience. You need to publish, and if you want to stay in academia, maybe publish an \"important\" (read: widely cited; read: popular) paper, but you will also likely post-doc, which is another stage for personal growth and exploration.  Physics is also widely generalizable to many areas, from biology to social sciences and finance, and if you have experience with high performance computing, even more areas, although this is not necessary. One of my thesis committee members is a physicist who is applying his training to genomics and has changed his entire field multiple times. Just work on getting exposure, keep an open mind, and good luck!  "

Luckily, you are in an academic department, which is a great place to interact with researchers.  Do any of your professors participate in active research? Ask them what projects they are working on. Ask them if they've always researched the same area. Ask them what they worked on as graduate students. Who taught your electromagnetism class? Go ask them if they use any EM in their research.  Are there graduate students? Ask them what they're working on.  Are there colloquia given by outside researchers at your institution? These talks are specifically designed to teach you something about the speaker's current research. You can hear about what people do. Bring a pen and paper. Write down key words to look up later. If a talk seemed interesting (even if two thirds was way over your head), hang around for a few minutes after and ask the speaker a question. Say \"I'm a senior thinking about grad school. How many grad students are in your group? Are you looking for more?\"  When researchers use jargon or say something you don't understand ask them to clarify. Don't be afraid, they know you're an undergraduate. They won't think you're not smart enough for asking. They'll think you're insightful and interested.  Later go look up some key words from the discussion on the internet. Don't look up the latest papers.

Problem is, I am about to graduate, so I will technically not be an undergraduate this summer. I do intend to continue my education in graduate school in the Fall, and have been admitted somewhere.  I've been told that I should just kick back and relax this summer so that I'm fully unwound for grad school, but I don't have any money to travel, all my friends will have left for their grad school already, and there's really nothing that would stress me out more than sitting around and doing nothing for three months. I love to travel, make new friends, and learn cool stuff, so I think doing another REU would actually be the perfect way for me to unwind.  At my last REU, we had a student who had graduated that year and was about to go into a Master's program. It was rumored that she had omitted/lied about this on her application and the admissions people just didn't look into it carefully. I don't know if this is true, though. It seems possible that the program staff simply felt her application was strong enough to warrant making an exception - after all, she wasn't _going_ to grad school yet.  > Is it possible to be admitted to a mathematics REU the summer between > undergrad and graduate school?

That would make it much easier to get the PhD student to do his work by reminding him of the deadlines and of your stake in the project. If you are just supposed to get no authorship or only a footnote acknowledgement, you could let it be and let the PhD student dictate the pace of work. When you don't have a stake in the paper, you are not losing anything if it gets delayed and someone else publishes it before you. It is his loss, not yours.  Now, in your current situation, I would approach the student (perhaps together with the PI) and ask about the timeframe for the project and if there are deadlines. This will automatically have the effect of reminding the PhD student that he has to do his part of the work. It will also get the PI's attention without looking like you are complaining about the PhD student to him.

Anything it possible, but nothing you have said gives any indication anyone else thinks they should be a co-author for this result, assuming it is publishable. It's common in math that a problem seems difficult from one perspective, but is easy from another. This can always be a little embarrassing, but usually it's no big deal if you're dealing with reasonable mathematicians. However, it may mean (for a variety of possible reasons) that the problem is less interesting to them than originally thought, and this could be part of what you're sensing. I've often gotten excited about discovering things, only to realize later that they weren't so novel, or been interested in problems because I thought my methods could solve them then lost interest when I found out other methods are much better.

Your advisor may be upset that he/she didn't anticipate this possibility and head it off.  One of the basic rules of the mathematical community is that you don't compete with graduate students by working on their thesis problems. This rule isn't always followed, but exceptions are rare and they look terrible unless you have an awfully good excuse. The reason is that grad students are generally inexperienced and slow compared with faculty, which makes it unfair to compete with them. There's little glory in winning, and you can do an awful lot of damage if you swoop in and ruin someone's thesis.  Of course this rule is not really aimed at undergraduates, and you aren't in nearly as awkward a situation as a faculty member would be. However, the fact that you could prove the theorem indicates that you are unusually talented, in which case it could still look bad if you screw things up for a less talented student.  I don't mean to suggest that you are primarily to blame. It sounds like you were put in a delicate situation without being warned about potential pitfalls, and your advisor should not have let this come about. However, when you started trying to prove the theorem, what did you think was going to happen to this graduate student if you succeeded? There are various possibilities (restarting work on a different problem, hoping to find extensions substantive enough for a thesis before you prove them, dropping out of grad school), but they aren't terribly appealing.  It comes across as callous to be more concerned with getting credit yourself than the repercussions for this graduate student. You deserve credit and should get it, but I'd recommend having a discussion with your advisor (in private) about how to avoid causing problems for the grad student. For example, maybe there are directions for follow-up work that you could leave to him to explore. This could help relieve the tension by showing that you realize it's an awkward situation and want to make sure the other student has a viable path forward.  "

Follow JeffE's advice: You have at least three people who contributed to the proof of the theorem. The advisor who suggested the problem. The grad student who worked out several ways that don't work. And you who produced a proof. So it is perfectly valid to write a joint paper. In mathematics it is pretty important to figure out ways how not to prove something. (There are papers and blog posts by renowned mathematicians starting with \"How not to prove\u2026\", e.g a paper called \"[How not to prove the Poincare conjecture](http://www.ams.org/mathscinet-getitem?mr=2906378)\", the blog post \"[How not to prove that P is not equal to NP](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2013/10/03/how-not-to-prove-that-p-is-not- equal-to-np/)\", the paper \"[How not to prove Fermat's last theorem](http://www.jstor.org/stable/2325146)\".)

It is really common to try two different ways to prove something, see how each one fails at a different point and then see that some third way will succeed. In addition the grad student may well be able to write a good introduction on the background and context of the theorem.  > Is it possible they will try to bully me out of first-authorship to protect > the reputation of the PhD student?  There is not such thing as \"first-authorship\" in mathematics, see here: <https://mathoverflow.net/questions/19987/math-paper-authors-order>  "

        "answer_body": "  (Too long for a comment.)  Worrying about potential consequences to some grad student is a task of their supervisor, yet _this is not an ideal world_. To a various degree, most of us frequently act with a wider context in mind, protecting others from their (usually) temporary stupidity. Note that in many countries some things are explicitly forbidden instead of only marked as dangerous. This is also one of the reasons why some people are great team players, while others aren't. Moreover, this is often far from easy, there are lot of factors the difference that matters might be slight, like saying that everybody is alright _before_ that there was a car crash.  Doing math is a social activity, and we should consider other people feelings.   **We should strive for an excellence, but that is no excuse for being a jerk.**  I think @JeffE's solution (a joint publication) is the best one.   Do not accept giving away the result, but a joint paper should be ok (with an alphabetical order of authors). Be aware that although in math the author order does not matter, it might matter for some other things (scholarship rules, etc.). Perhaps the grad student can do some additional work to justify coauthorship if you are unsure. Talk it over.  As for the change in attitude, normally it would depend whether that was a change in attitude towards you, or towards the problem and situation in general, whether it was positive (more respect) or negative (you are a threat), permanent or temporary (it's normal for people to get grumpy for a few days). In your case however, unless you have some special circumstances, I advise you to pick a different place for your PhD.  I hope this helps ;-)  "

        "answer_body": "  If you ever need to defend yourself against a charge of plagiarism you will want evidence/proof of originality. Before you do anything else I would create what is called a \"Poor Man's Copyright\" as such evidence. **NOTICE: I am not a lawyer and this is not legal advice** (this is just what _I_ would do based on my experience) **so use at your own risk:**  Do the following but make every effort **not** to use campus-owned supplies (paper, blank DVDs, etc) or equipment (computers, copiers, etc) unless you have no choice (mainframe screen-grabs). Do not give anyone an excuse to say you were misusing University resources:    * Write this up _as quickly as you can_ , even if it is not perfect ... probably what you have already written is sufficient. Date it now if it does not already have a date on it.    * Print a copy of the writeup and put it in a simple long envelope.    * Take that long envelope mail it FROM a post office to your home address. Send it via \"registered mail, signature required, and return receipt requested\". Be sure the envelope is well sealed.    * **_DO THIS TODAY!_**  The above is the essence of a poor-man's copyright and is the very least you can do (see the very last bullet paragraph below for how it is used) but you can expand on this by **ALSO** doing the following:    * Print another copy of the write-up and all the supporting documentation that can be printed. If there is software code or data for documentation either make some screen-grabs (cell phones pics are ok) or burn it to a CD-ROM / DVD disc (or disc sets). Make 4 of these discs (or disc sets). **WARNING: Do not copy any software code/data you did not create yourself.**   * Photocopy **three** sets of everything (use a copystore away from campus if you have a choice and get a receipt). Use a black & white copier except for any specific pages that would make no sense without color.   * Copiers malfunction so **double-check before you leave the store** that all FOUR sets (including the original set) are complete AND legible. Did you get everything back on your originals? Do your three copy sets all have the same pages as the original set? _In the same order?_   * Have four envelopes/folders/boxes (whatever you need for carrying each set in a single container). Once you have verified all is complete put each set in its own container then go home.   * From this point on do not write anything on those originals or change that set in any way. Keep the original documents in their container and leave it alone. Hands off!   * At home count the number of pages (count twice, double-check) then **on the copies ONLY** with a RED pen number every sheet with \"X/Y\" (or \"X of Y\" if you prefer). Also put \"Copy A\" or \"Copy B\" or \"Copy C\" as appropriate. Work slowly and carefully as all three sets must have **matching** sequence numbers. If you make a mistake put a line through it, initial it, and correct it. It is okay to write over the photocopied text if you must, that is why you are using a red pen.   * Next type up a simple letter telling your story as you did here (but with all the names, dates, and problem description included) and closing the narrative with a declaration that you are the sole creator of the proof and also personally created \"the attached documents\".    * In the header of the letter put \"AFFIDAVIT OF EVENTS\" centered across the top of each page and also be sure the letter formatting includes \"page X of Y\" in the footer.   * On the same letter, immediately after your narrative, include an attachments inventory summarizing one set of everything you copied (\"Item 001: 2 pages describing the proof\", \"Item 002: 14 pages of data representing XYZ\", \"Item 003: 1 screen grab from the department mainframe terminal\", etc.). If you have any discs include them on the list last (\"Item 29: 2 CD's containing R code used to demonstrate the proof.\").    * At the bottom of the letter include a statement that declares everything above to be true and affirm that you are the sole author of the letter.    * Include a space for your signature but **do not sign it yet**. Also leave **at least** a half-page of space on the same page after your signature. Reformat/resize the text/font/margins/etc if you have to but that half-page space is important.    * Take ONLY the original set of documents and the _unsigned_ letter and go to a (NON-campus) notary public (ask your bank manager if you don't know where to find one). Be sure you have your official photo id (driver's license or passport) with you. Also note a \"notary public\" is **_NOT_** the same thing as a \"notario publico\" -- a sort of specialized lawyer from some Spanish speaking countries -- so don't confuse the two).    * Tell the NP you have created a \"personal affidavit\" of events and wish to have it notarized. Take out your letter and IMMEDIATELY sign it in front of the notary THEN hand it over to them to read. Be sure you sign the letter's signature space in the presence of the notary using a BLUE ink pen, NOT a black one. That is important because most notaries use black ink for the areas they have you sign but when the letter is photocopied it is hard to decide which is the original if _everything_ is black.    * The notary is only going to glance at the letter to be sure it is in fact what you have described (an affidavit). It is unlikely they will spend more than about 30 seconds doing this. They may also ask about the attachments (since they are referenced in the letter) but it is unlikely, but if they do show them the originals. Again, their primary concern is that the document is what it says it is, not the contents per-Se.   * They will have a form or imprint of some sort to attach to that letter (which is what the half-page space is for). Depending on what state you are in you may be asked to \"swear or affirm an oath\" that what you have written is true. There will be a little paperwork and some sort of thumbprint will be taken. You will be charged about $10 (ten dollars) for each signature required (which should be only one).    * Take the notarized letter and go get _at least_ FOUR additional copies made, but a couple extra above 4 is a good idea. Put the original letter in with the original documentation and close the container. With luck you will never open this container again.   * Go home. Put the container with the originals somewhere safe. Next get the other 3 documentation containers and put one copy of the letter into each container. Put \"Copy A\" aside, that will become the one you show folks in general, if you need to.    * Take one copy of the letter and put it in a simple long envelope.    * Take that long envelope and also the \"Copy B\" container (with its own copy of the letter inside) and mail _each_ of them (one letter by itself, one container with a letter & docs inside) FROM a post office to your home address. Send them both via \"registered mail, signature required, and return receipt requested\". Be sure and tell the Post Office if you have included any CD/DVD discs in the package as these may affect their security scanners.   * Take the \"Copy C\" container with a letter inside and ship it FROM a Federal Express office (Kinko's copystores usually) to your home address. You may need to put it in one of their official envelopes/boxes. Send it \"signature required\". Be sure and tell FedEx if there are any CD/DVD discs in the package.   * **_NOW THE MOST IMPORTANT STEP OF ALL:_** When the letters and containers arrive at your home, put them aside somewhere safe and NEVER OPEN them. Put the 3 packages (the Originals, Copy A and Copy B) in three different places so they are safe from fire/water damage/theft). These letters/packages should only be opened in a courtroom (with your lawyer present) since once the seal is broken the proof of the date of their contents is lost.   Hopefully this all resolves without any accusations or legal evidence required but at least you will have this if you need it. **_Good luck and be proud of the proof work you did._**  "

        "answer_body": "  It's worth keeping in mind that in the long term the amount of \"credit\" that this result is worth to anyone is almost certainly very very small. Math is very hard, and it's very rare to find genuinely important questions that an undergraduate or a weak graduate student can solve. Most of the value of undergraduate research is learning whether you enjoy the process of research and not in the result itself. Most of the value in an average PhD thesis is the training in the process of research and not in the problem itself. I feel like a lot of the answers and comments here are treating this like the amount of credit involved in your result is unrealistically large. In the long run, people care about your research program, and this paper will fall outside of that program, and so won't be important in evaluating you.  That said, it's a great experience for you to solve an open problem! Hopefully this has showed you that you're capable of getting a PhD and that you would enjoy it. It also should be valuable to you in that it should show admissions committees these two facts! It is also worth remembering that this \"credit\" to the admissions committee is at least as much in how your letters of recommendation talk about this result as it is in the publication itself (which may well not be through peer review when you apply for grad school).  So think about this more in terms of experience and less in terms of piling up formal credit. Talk to your advisor and figure out what is best for you in terms of further experience. Maybe there's a solution that will also allow you to learn valuable collaboration skills by working with the graduate student on related questions. You will also learn valuable skills by writing up the paper (whether alone or in collaboration). All of these things will make you a stronger graduate school candidate and a more prepared researcher. A strong letter that says you're an excellent problem solver and an excellent collaborator and great to work with is how you get the most credit. Generosity and credit are not enemies of each other.

        "answer_body": "  Ok practical advise. Not purely focused at Math. Depending on the subfield a lot of this might be irrelevant (or alt very relevant)    * **Avoid:** Look out for re-occuring thesis topics within your school. Cherck last-years list of topics (and prior years), if the same topic is mentioned avoid it. If when you meet the supervisor he says \"you'll carry on from the work of last years undergrad student\". This is a bad sign.       * If a topic is offered again, this means that previous students have not been able to complete it satisfactory. Which may be a sign that the topic itself is flawed. Maybe it is really really hard. Maybe it requires particular equipment that is prone to break down. Working on a \"legacy project\" is always harder (ask any software dev).   * **Look for:** supervisor who has been around the school for a long time, and is fairly senior staff. What you are looking for is **Realpolitik** , and having supervised many undergrad thesis before. Undergrad thesis tend to be full of bizarre and unusual requirements; because they often occupy a weird space in the curriculum; e.g. being considered officially a \"coursework\" unit or other odd things.       * So you want from your supervisor an understanding of these rules; and how to loop hole them; or the capacity to pressure the higher powers to ignore them.   * **Avoid:** topics that are not compatible with the requirements of the marking guide. Be aware of what the marking requirement of the thesis are, and chose project to suit. Part of the aforementioned undergraduate thesis are weird is that they might not be assessed on what they look like they are; completing the projects goals perfectly might yield poor marks.       * For example, my undergrad area was Engineering. There were a lot of \"Design and Build\" topics offered. Where you would design something then build it. However the marking guide is taken from the Science faculty. So it is not about designing something to do a task. It is about designing a experiment to test a hypothesis. There are no marks for building at all; even though it is the hardest part. Be on the look out for things.   * **Look for** : for opportunities to make multiple contacts. For applying for Post-grad you need multiple recommendation letters. One will certainly come from your undergrad thesis supervisor. But if you got to work with someone else significant in the university, then that is a great second reference. For example one of my friends had to do a lot of electron microscope work. So he also got a great contacts with (and training from) all the people in the Microscopy center. I think his second reference came from the head of that lab.     * **Avoid** : things that cost money. While there might be a university provided budget for your thesis; extracting money from a university can be like squeezing water from a stone. There may be a bunch of paperwork, and it may take months. However, this can be cancelled out, if the supervisor has great realpolitik -- and can thus pullout money easily.    * **Look for:** chances to grab useful training. I mentioned my friend who did tones of microscope work. That goes on a resume. Working on super-computers, or large clusters; another rareish marketable skill.      * When you begin your PhD your may have to justify that you have certain skilled. Having used them in your undergrad thesis is a solid demonstration.  "

        "answer_body": "  I am in math, and have some experience with undergrad research (from both sides), and there are lots of different ways you could have a good experience with undergrad research. What would be good for you will depend a lot on your individual situation (mathematical maturity, background, independence, etc) and your goals (do you want to get a paper out of it? just get some research experience? learn something new? help your case for grad schools?).    * For getting into a good grad school, what's most important is how well prepared you are in terms of background and how much potential you show. This is evidenced by your transcript and recommendation letters. Doing novel research or writing a paper is much less important (unless it's much more impressive than typical undergrad math research). (Note: many undergrad theses in math are just an exposition of an important topic. Some of these are very good.) So in terms of grad school, the most important thing out of this project will probably be (1) what you learn, and (2) the impression you make on your supervisor, who should write you a recommendation.    * For being able to get a paper out of it, research is never certain, but it's important that the project is well thought out beforehand. More open-ended projects may sound interesting, and teach you a lot, but may not be conducive to having a finished project in the time available. I generally find ones that involve some calcutions/computation have a higher rate of \"success,\" in the sense you should at least be able to do the calculations, whereas projects that require you to develop some theory may just leave you completely stumped. (Though some types of theoretical projects where you can follow the method of another paper closely also have high rates of success. Conversely, try to stay away from projects of the form \"look for pattern in this data.\") Hopefully you can get a sense of how well thought out the project is from the description; also knowing how successful the supervisor was with previous students may suggest this person gives high-percentage or low-percentage success problems (but if you're more concerned about grad school, where the students went for grad school is more important than if they published papers).    * For learning things (which helps with grad school), a project where you have to learn some theory (even if just to do computations) is better.    * Both to make progress and to learn things, an accessible advisor (say is willing to meet you once a week or so) is better.  Apart from that, I would say put some value in your general impression from talking to the potential supervisor. If you have a chance to talk to former students of the supervisor, that could also be useful.  "

        "answer_body": "  I am a graduate student, and I often hire undergraduate research assistants.  My primary motivation in hiring undergraduate research assistants is to create opportunities for these students to get a sense of what research is about, gain some experience that can help them get a job or admission to graduate school, and help them figure out what they want to do next.  Sometimes my undergraduate students do work that is tedious, because research can sometimes be tedious. This is especially true when they are inexperienced, because it can be hard to see the bigger picture behind what you're doing. (They may not even have the necessary background to understand the bigger picture, at least not until they've taken some more advanced coursework and read a few dozen research articles.) A good supervisor tries to help students see the big picture, but it's hard.  Supervising undergraduate students is a lot of work for me. I don't do it because it somehow helps me progress in my research by offloading tasks that I really need to get done (if anything, it slows down my research). Usually the work I give to undergrads is work that isn't on the critical path for my own personal research, because I can't trust that it will get done quickly/correctly. And in most cases, by the time my undergrads have learned enough to really be useful to me, they're graduating.  I hire these students because I remember how meaningful my undergraduate research experience was to me, and I want to pay it forward.  To directly answer your question,  > How ethical or common is it for grad students to actively hire undergrads > into their lab for the sole purpose of outsourcing tedious labour?  It's probably much less common than you think, for the reasons described above. It _can_ happen sometimes in the context of a research effort in which someone has to collect a lot of data, and it doesn't require any knowledge or skill to do so. But even then, it's often quicker for the graduate student to do it himself.  When it does happen, I see no ethical problem as long as the nature of the work is disclosed to the undergrad before he/she accepts the job. Compared to many other student jobs (working the phones and calling alumni for donations, for example), being a pipette monkey is actually probably one of the better jobs.  "

Although this can be a double edge sword, the undergraduate student can miss up! We make sure that there is a graduate student or lab technician around the undergraduate students to supervise them and provide direction.   3. We only use the top 1-3 undergraduate students. Those who we know are interested in going to graduate school. This has many advantages as you can expect.   4. They don't work for free!

Lets address the parts of your question one at a time, paraphrasing a bit for the sake of clarity:  > Is it common?  Yes, it's reasonably common to hire an undergraduate assistant to handle boring tasks.  > Is it ethical?  This line of questioning seems to have become popular on this site of late: \"There is a thing I don't like, is it ethical?\" without really articulating why it wouldn't be ethical. Lets say I hire a undergraduate to do the most boring job in my lab. Is that _less_ ethical than if I was the manager at the local Arby's? Or the university library?  _There is no ethical obligation to keep an undergraduate entertained and engaged_. I have exchanged money for their time and effort. That's all.  > Is this frowned upon and is it really any different than a typical undergrad > research opportunity.  It's certainly not frowned upon, see above. As to whether or not it's different from a typical undergrad research opportunity, that very much depends on what you mean by \"typical\".  But I will say this: Research is often tedious.  Undergraduate research is often especially tedious because it's often a small chunk of a larger process, and one that can be \"safely\" given to someone with relatively little expertise and experience. That is not to say it is not essential work - what's given to undergrads is often \"Someone has to do this, and it will take lots of time.\" If a graduate student or professor does it, they can't be doing other things. If an undergrad does it, they can work on advancing the project in other ways in parallel.  Consider some examples from my field:    * Abstracting Data: Much of the data for outbreaks of infectious diseases doesn't come in nice, machine readable forms. Instead, it comes in nice, human readable weekly reports, describing what happened that week. Wading through those is tedious and boring - find a number, update some rows on a spreadsheet, rinse, repeat. But someone has to do it. Similarly, one of my first research jobs was taking meteorological reports that were in old hard copies and transcribing them.   * Citation tracking: Find a number in the published literature - see where they got it from. See where they got it from got it from. Follow that rabbit hole as far as it goes. Again, this is pretty mindless.  Yes, these are boring. They also have to be done. And in my experience, they're valuable research experience. Wading through references looking for something is how I ended up writing my first review paper. A student (admittedly a graduate student) in a lab I worked in ended up being quite prominent for maintaining some data that was largely just tedious abstraction and making it public.  As @ff524 has said however, this is not without effort, especially if you're also trying to make sure the student is learning and engaging in research. Undergraduates are likely slower, more prone to make mistakes, and need more supervision. It's a lot of investment in time and energy for someone who - if all goes according to plan - won't actually be around for very long.  "

The usual process is to talk with lots of professors and potential advisers, read over their research, look carefully at all topics that come up in class, read a variety of books and keep your mind open and working on what you are really interested in...and that is going to take a lot more time than you have.  So frankly, you are going to need to \"wing it\" - to \"fire from the hip\" and hope for the best in terms of this particular scholarship application if it indeed has the hard deadline of 'today'. For this I would suggest you review the general ideas in this helpful professor's published works, as you mentioned you have already done, and point your finger towards whatever topic sounds kind of doable to you and is generally an area you might like to work more on in the future - or at least you think you might like to. And something vaguely in that realm could be your proposed topic. Just write it up and get it out.  Once you have gotten past the emergency of the deadline, you should certainly talk with the professor more about potential topics. But there is no replacement for having your own ideas and interests, and what is a great topic for one person is torture to someone else. By all means, keep working on it and developing your interests and awareness of what you might like to work on in the future - but for now, get that scholarship app done while you still can!  "

You are saying that you cannot find \"eligible students at our own institution who are both qualified and interested\". Do a bootcamp in what they need to know. Most of the students who attended the HPC REU knew how to program but didn't know anything about high- performance computing, so the [detailed schedule](http://hpcreu.umbc.edu/summer2016/schedule/) showed us that we would learn this (and get credit). Most of the time undergraduates take \"standard\" classes so they will never learn these research skills even if that's what they want to be researching, so **showing them that your REU is the jumpstart to their research career in the particular field generates the interest**. Also, if you can show that this is applicable to them even if they are not into research, then you have a large crowd. If you look at other REUs they also have a few training weeks in some useful subjects as well.  Another thing is to try and make it a **group project**. Undergraduates haven't had enough time to learn subjects to \"research-level\" yet, and if it's an interdisciplinary project, it's almost impossible. Many mathematical biology projects take a group of students where one knows math, one can program well, and another may just be a straight biologist. They work together to solve the problem (or get as far as possible) and learn from each other.  Although I found my REUs via their websites, I know others that found out about their REUs via departmental emails. **Send emails out to friends/administrators at other institutions** to forward to their administrators. Some of the best places for recruitment can be **liberal arts colleges** because sometimes the department may not have every subfield. In a liberal arts college there are close ties between students and faculty and so many times the faculty will know about subfields that students are wanting to try out. Then the faculty may even forward the email to some of their students saying \"I know you're interested in ______, check this out!\".  Also, **be ready to adapt what you're doing** to the undergraduates. Most REU projects don't result in a publication, so if you're looking for undergraduates who will help you on your current project, it's probably a waste of time. Of course you don't want to go too far out of your expertise, but play around with ideas and try some new things. For example, if you're an experimental scientist who's interested in trying machine learning for your type of data, pair up with a new faculty member who does machine learning and get a group of undergraduates to try doing some machine learning on your data under joint supervision. Again, it's most likely not going to end up with results, but this new collaboration can turn out to be an exciting result itself.  Lastly, think about being the undergraduate. What is the undergraduate looking for? First and foremost, the **best undergraduates are looking for what will look good on a graduate school application**. Cater to that. Make the summer bootcamp worth credit. Guarantee that at least a technical report will be online. Teach them a few programming languages. Give access to GRE classes. Etc.  "

A week ago I sent an email to an external professor (I mean, not one in my University) asking about whether we could discuss about the topic I chose. The mail was (I believe) properly structured - not spammy and personally tailored on the prof, citing some works on the topic I took a look on, explaining my motivations on why I would like to study this topic, maybe a bit lengthy but not that much and divided in paragraphs - yet I had no answer.  For what I know it seems that this is not necessarily a \"no\" and a common suggestion is to write a reminder.  Now, I would really like to work on this topic and taking contact with this professor would be a great chance for me, especially in order to continue my studies with a PhD. At the same time, this professor is quite important and maybe he just doesn't care too much about a M.Sc. thesis, so I was thinking to write a reminder asking, in short, if he could send me the contact of one of his PhD/postdoc students that may be interested in helping me with my work.  My question is: is this considered a bad etiquette? writing first to a prof and then rolling back to one of his students...may sound like I underestimated his position or I am just not motivated enough.   In case, how could I structure the message? It seems to me that \"if you are too busy\" is a bad way to start (sounds like I don't know whether the professor has anything to do or that he could be doing nothing). Also \"I know you are very busy but...\" sounds bad (but what? but I don't care? but I think it is more important to stop and talk with me?). So what could be a polite way to go for it?  ",

        "answer_body": "  Let me start with my personal experience from similar situations: professors rarely respond to emails of this nature.  This is partly because many people bombard professors' inboxes with emails about joining their research group every day. So it is highly likely that he has not read your email carefully or at all.  Here are my suggestions:    1. At the beginning of your email mention that you tried contacting him before. This simple act has been very effective in my experience. Possibly because the professor might take time to read your email more carefully knowing that you've been trying to contact him for a while. I sometimes mention that I understand that they get a lot of emails from potential applicants every day and that I suspect that they may have missed my previous email.    2. Choose the topic of your email wisely. If the topic says something like \"interested in your research\" it would garner less interest from the professor than if you mention that you are interested in some sort of collaboration on a research project.    3. Try to keep your email short, and try to put the information that may make him interested at the beginning of the email. For example, it may help to let him know that you are not looking for admission to their university or a funding opportunity.    4. Since this person is likely the corresponding author on the papers published by his group you could use this for a different approach. For example, read the articles he has published that are close to the research project you wish to work on and ask questions you may have in that context. Maybe this could be a way to open the communication line.  "

If he/she is well known in the field of study, as you said, then it's likely he/she is having many similar enquiries and can't respond to all of them. Also as others have said - Professors don't always reply immediately. In either case, sending a second e-mail doesn't hurt and the Prof. won't generally get annoyed at you for sending \"already a second email\".  In my opinion, there is also nothing wrong with contacting the PhD / PostDoc person **most relevant to your question**. Don't spam the entire lab, but write to someone and suggest that you asked the Professor earlier, but didn't get a reply (yet) - probably because he/she is too busy.  In our lab it is common that these sort of e-mails do get forwarded (from the Prof.) to the entire lab - you won't know about this, but I guess it's not uncommon.  Since, as you said, this is concerning a Masters Thesis and you are not at the same university as the Professor, unfortunately, your enquiry will be pretty low on the priority list. Why? Because, the Professor has to attend his/her students at the local university first. They also have to write their Masters Thesis and the Professors have an obligation to take them on (at least where I went to university). So don't be disappointed, but don't expect this to actually go anywhere.  **[EDIT]**  Depending on the popularity of the Professor, you may also have to assume that they never read your mail in the first place, because they simply can't read all their mail. In an ideal world, they would hire assistants / secretaries to help out, but that costs money and not every Professor ca do that.  So, a probably not uncommon approach for Professors is, to simply delete all mail that is older than X days, because they can't possibly go through them and if it was important, the person would have written back or called. In my own experience, even the PhD students and PostDocs wouldn't always get a reply from their own Professor, unless they send the same mail 3-4 times. Of course that's counterproductive, but if it's the only way to get a reply, you don't have a choice.  In the end I would include \"Reminder\" or something like that in the Subject- Line. The Professors I know are more concerned about efficiency, than etiquette. They want to get to the point quickly and don't have to read through apologies.  The most polite way I would come up with would be to say something like:  > Please allow me to remind you of my request...  No need to tell Professors that they are busy ;) I also often see the request to forward something to their lab, actually being honoured. But as I said before, if you can reach one of the lab members - they all conduct their own research and surely have conversations with different people all the time - no need for the Professor to approve.

It should be a win-win situation. However, it is not the responsibility of the advisor to financially support the student. That is an ideal situation but not a requirement. Sometimes it happens, but when it doesn't, it's the student's responsibility to figure out how to eat and pay the rent while volunteering in a research lab. It's not the most pleasant arrangement but that's how it works. It's hard work training students (trust me) and it's hard work being a student!  tl;dr The suggestion to tell your advisor, \"I want to continue my research, but I first need to find part-time work to support myself\" is spot-on!

It came back with more red than black.  Also, don't forget the resources a professor can give you. As an undergrad, I had an idea for which I needed a couple of hours in a student lab using non consumable and safe equipment, but I wasn't allowed. I then suggested the project to a professor, and a word from him gave me full access to whatever lab I would need. Depending on your case, this may mean data, computers, or having a conversation with an expert in something you may be stuck with.  So, chances are that if you work by yourself, you will have the same problems. Either you will work on something irrelevant or some known dead end; and when you get a result, you will have a hard time putting it in a publication ready form. Take as an example your own question: you wrote one paragraph, and three people have already considered your post unclear. A several pages research article, where not even the researcher fully understands what is going on, is significantly more difficult.  You can, of course, go ahead and try to research something you find interesting on your own, but your chances of getting published are significantly lower than if you have a mentor. You would have to jump many more hurdles.  "

This student was in a ``Introduction to Proofs'' course that I taught. I know that recommendation letters from grad students for grad school are looked upon poorly; is the same true for REUs? Applying for REUs is rather different than applying for grad school, so perhaps it is more accepted in this case.  If the best option for this student is to have me write the letter, what should a good letter from a grad student focus on? Since I don't have as extensive a teaching record as a professor I can't realistically compare them to other students I have had-- is it enough to talk about their excellent performance in the course I taught?  In case anyone is concerned about the student, I brought up the issue of me being a grad student when they asked for the letter, and after guidance from a faculty member they still think my letter is their best option (a professor is writing a letter as well).

As noted in the comments, a strong letter from a graduate student can often be much better than a weak letter from a professor. I have personal experience with this as well: even as a graduate student I wrote letters for undergraduates who had worked with me that appear to have helped them (or at least didn't prevent their application to various programs from succeeding). Moreover, since they also have a letter from a professor, they're not without faculty recommendation.  Finally, an REU is a much lower-stakes application than a Ph.D. program: the degree of commitment on the part of the hiring party is lower so they may be more willing to take risks, and if the student misses there are often many alternatives for getting research experience in the same time period.

Overall, we will not take letters from graduate students very seriously when considering students for admission. The basic problem is that few graduate students have the perspective to judge an undergraduate's potential to do research. When I look back to my own time in graduate school, I know that I would not have done a particularly good job evaluating undergraduates' relevant skills.  While a letter from a graduate student would be essentially worthless when a student is applying to graduate school, an REU program is a more relaxed and lower stakes admission process. So getting a letter from a graduate student would not necessarily doom an application. If I received such a letter, I would write back promptly to the applicant asking for another letter from a faculty member. If we did not receive a replacement letter from a professor, we would not rule the application out automatically, but it would have to be very strong otherwise to make the cut (and students who are very strong applicants would often have little trouble getting a good faculty letter to begin with).  Other programs may be more willing to accept at least one letter from a graduate student, so if you feel that you have adequately warned the student about the risks in having you as a recommender, you may want to go ahead and write the letter. However, you should definitely look at the admission requirements for the specific REU programs; if they specifically ask for faculty letters, I would suggest that you decline to write.  "

        "answer_body": "  I apologize for the length of my reply, but I think this is a really great question that I discuss with undergraduates and even grad students all the time, and want to use this as an opportunity to share some of my thoughts with you.  I completely agree with the points that F\u00e1bio Dias made in his answer. However, I want to add one general tip with you that I have found to be extremely effective in my experience both presenting talks and posters as well as judging them.  The way I see it, when undergraduate talks/posters are judged, there may or may not be certain specific criteria against which you will be evaluated, but there are certain important subtleties in how you _conduct yourself_ when talking about your work that will almost always affect your evaluation whether there is specific criteria or not. Let me clarify:  As F\u00e1bio Dias mentioned, there are many important technical factors that are commonly taken into account when judging presentations, but aside from this, I believe that one of the most powerful tools to get great scores on research talks is to demonstrate some passion and interest into the work you are presenting.  This is typically the biggest problem with undergraduate presentations. Undergraduates are often not very well-versed in the big picture of their research project and therefore end up simply presenting what they did and what data came of it and what they think it means (or what their advisor told them it means). There is rarely any visible interest in the work, or evidence of creative thought on the part of the student, and this is the biggest factor that separates a great undergrad talk from all other undergrad talks.  No matter how dull your research talk may or may not be to you, when you stand up there in front of all those people, make sure to talk and act like you're the most excited person in the room about the work that you have done. This gets people's attention, in my opinion, above all else. Some great ways of doing this are:    * Never, ever, ever, ever, ever read from your slides, especially your title. Always come up with a great \"prose\" way to describe your whole project and then your data.   * Try to look at your slides as little as possible, unless you're pointing out something on a figure. Look at the audience, glance around the room. In a scientific forum setting, simple presentation skills often directly translate into command of the material being presented.   * A great way to prevent yourself from doing the above is to not have many words on your slides, this keeps people interested and keeps you from reading to the audience. Many undergrads believe that their research cannot be presented without many words on the slides, but there is almost always a creative way to do this.   * Question yourself, and question your research. This does not mean you should tell the audience that your conclusions are not accurate, but rather avoid being too rigid in how you describe your conclusions. Avoid words phrases like 'definitely,' 'clearly,' 'this means that,' 'we discovered,' or any version of the word prove/proof/proved, unless used as a technical term such as 'mathematical proof.'   * Always talk about your work in terms of what it could mean for the future, For example, talk about some interesting data that you couldn't yet explain; offer several possible ways to frame your conclusions; try to add a few \"next steps\" to your presentation (and not as a list on the last slide, but work it in in a few places as you talk about your work).   * If you anticipate a question or questions from the audience that you will probably not know how to answer, bring it out in the open as part of your presentation, and say that you are still working to understand that particular part of your project.  Some of these things may seem trivial or obvious, but these are probably the most common \"mistakes\" undergraduate students typically make when giving oral presentations. I say \"mistakes\" lightly because it is obvious that sometimes the student simply does not get the proper guidance from their advisers, either about their project, or about how to present the work properly, or both. In these cases, of course, acting like you truly love your project may not be possible because it may not be true.  But either way, what it boils down to usually, coming back to something F\u00e1bio Dias said above, is that at the undergraduate level, the expectation is less on whether the results are impressive, but rather whether you can demonstrate that you are a good researcher, and that you have done the most with the results that you have.  Good Luck!  "

        "answer_body": "  The PhD thesis should be on a much higher level than the Honours/Masters thesis, offering a contribution to human knowledge that is of a sufficient level of \"significance\" to warrant publication in a respected journal.  Significance is highly subjective, and you also do not necessarily have to publish to be awarded the PhD (sometimes the peer-review delay means that they come out afterwards, or there may be some intellectual property issues that make it beneficial to refrain from publication). It is awarded based on your supervisors consent and a review of academics in your field. So the \"significance\" would probably be judged by them in terms of how much original work they see as a reasonable expectation at that stage of your development (first 3 years of serious/committed research). Unfortunately it also means that some people who probably do not deserve PhD's are awarded them anyway for fulfilling grunt work for their easy-going supervisors.  It is possible that some Honours/Masters thesis might even be more significant/higher quality than a PhD thesis. Unfortunately, this does not mean that the submission of the thesis will award the degree that they deserve. The university may have a policy to upgrade the student's enrolment if the supervisor senses that such progress is being made. However, it is impossible to upgrade to a PhD without completing Honours and I believe nearly every single university has a policy of a minimum period of enrolment before submission is allowed. A subsequent question that you may have is how to gain a PhD without enrolling in one, which is another level of achievement completely.  As for the difference between Honours/Bachelor and Masters it would depend on your university, but both have no requirement for publication quality research and are usually small tasks/ideas that are not worth the supervisors time to think about alone, or involve a lot of labor. In fact, in my school, many Honours thesis are of a higher level than the Masters, because the smart Honours students will either graduate into the work force or go straight into a PhD. The Masters students are usually those who cannot find a job and are not suited to research. However, I believe some other universities may require a mandatory Masters degree to start the PhD.  You may get a better idea by looking at some titles/abstracts of completed theses. The PhD level will be something like a new method/observation/application whereas the Masters/Honours will be an application specific set of measurements/simulations or even simply a literature review to gauge the needs of future work. The word limits are also typically different (although note that quality is NOT proportional to the number of words), with PhD at 100K, Masters at 50K and Honours at 30K at my university.  "

        "answer_body": "  Go back to basic definitions... In history of university degrees (500 years ago)  A bachelors degree is about learning existing knowledge. Historically from the book(s) written by the univ staff.  A masters degree, after you have learnt what is already known and in books in your topic area, is about learning evolving knowledge - that is near recent and current literature in academic journals and conference presentations.  A doctorate degree is about creating new knowledge by research.  So it is now easy to understand a thesis/dissertation for each degree.  A bachelors degree should be a critique of existing knowledge, often looking for inconsistencies in view points from different sources and synthesising arguments or positions in a DISSERTATION )that is you disserting !  A masters thesis (thesis is Greek for 'I believe') can be either an assembly of new knowledge from new published research or simply a critique and integration. It might have propositions (not hypotheses) that the masters student offers as a conclusion from bringing together new knowledge from different sources.  A doctoral thesis is where the author undertakes research, usually collecting primary new data which is presented as both factual findings and conceptual findings and thus new knowledge in the form of a new model or theory. Also possible, is to challenge existing knowledge and show earlier published knowledge is invalid.  Well that's what they all should be. In practice there is some overlap and different universities and faculties have their own custom and practice. It all starts to break down about 40 years ago when a masters degree become post graduate in time rather than post graduate in level. Thus engineers with a bachelor degree might take an MBA to make them more employable and did more a less a bachelor degree in business in 18 months rather than 3 years as they were already a graduate.  But still thinking in the above categories can help students today focus on the overall agenda.  I have examined over 55 PhD theses. And several hundred masters theses and I base my approach to assessment on the above.  Prof Peter Woolliams, B.Sc(hons), B.A., PhD, Emeritus professor, Anglian Ruskin College Cambridge, U K  "

      "question_body": "  I am a second year mathematics and physics student. My primary goal is to enter a post-graduate program in mathematics and hopefully progress further, should I possess the capability. I attend a South African university and have thus far taken the equivalent Calculus I, Precalculus, Numerical Analysis, and Differential Equations I courses. In the new semester I will begin Multivariable Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Analysis before commencing in the subsequent semester with secondary Analysis and Differential Equations courses, alongside Group Theory.  For the past six months or so I have been attempting to make headway on a few questions relating to sums of consecutive prime numbers, typing my (mostly trivial) results in LaTex. I would like to commence undergraduate research of some sort this year, even if it amounts to a professor assigning me problems appropriate for my experience level throughout the year when they can spare the time. Optimally, I would also like to garner the opportunity at some point in the year to discuss some of the questions that I have relating to the prime sums \u2013 what topics, textbooks, or papers I could read to progress further, and so on.  Unfortunately, however, my University does not have an official undergraduate research programme (like the URP for example), nor do I believe research- related requests from undergraduate students to be all too common (unlike the University [of this poster](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/51748/how-to-approach-a- professor-for-research), from my understanding). What is more is that there are only two Professors in my Department who have research interests in or related to Number Theory (one seems fairly open and is primarily focuses on Partition Theory), and neither of them have been or will be my lecturers going forward.  My main concern is coming across as disrespectful, entitled, or arrogant by reaching out to one of these professors for a potential research opportunity or mentorship.  What would be the generally acceptable way of seeking a research opportunity for a student studying at a University with no formal undergraduate research programme? Should I avoid emails all together, and if not would it be acceptable to mention offhandedly the minor research that I have conducted?

And as a university student, you should feel some entitlement to engage with the faculty beyond normal office hours or lectures -- so long as you don't abuse that access.  If you are concerned about appearing brash, send a brief, polite email asking for a meeting to discuss the mathematics you are interested in. If your professors do not want to set aside time to chat with a keen and driven undergraduate student about topics of mutual interest, then more fool them. Bear in mind, always, that professors often have a great deal of pressures on their time. However, I'm willing to bet that chatting about research would be a far more pleasurable activity than many other tasks a professor would have to tackle in the course of his or her day.  Personally, I make time to chat with any undergraduate student about the research I do, and any research they have done on their own accord, or how to further their interests.  "

It seems more that your professor has taken the leadership of the project (which is not strange for a project running in his group), and taken decisions that make you feel less comfortable.  Your fear is that you will not receive (enough) credit for suggesting the original idea. I think that it is best to address this in an early stage (i.e., now) to your professor. Most likely he will assure you that you will receive credit for the original idea. Write down any verbal guarantees that he might give to you in an email to the professor. Then during the execution of the project, make sure that any senior project member is aware of any agreement between you and the professor (e.g., by forwarding the email).

Even the personalized ones usually involve just a few \"fill in the blank\" additions, and it's clear that applicants sometimes share templates because I've received nearly identical e-mails from different applicants.  As far as I can tell, it's a vicious cycle. It's difficult to judge these applications, and most of them are wildly ill-matched or inappropriate, so recipients usually don't even reply. (I've found that replying is viewed by some applicants as a strong form of encouragement, even if I just say something like \"Sorry, I never have any interns and I don't work in area X in any case.\" I feel bad about it, but this is a powerful motivation not to reply.) The lack of replies pushes desperate students to send out huge numbers of e-mails, and this drives the response rate even lower. The net effect is that everyone ends up unhappy with the status quo. For example, see the comments [here](http://paulwgoldberg.blogspot.com/2011/02/iit-student-seeks- internship-at-your.html), which feature discussion from both faculty and internship applicants.  > If these are from real students, why do they think this could potentially > work?  It seems to have degenerated into a lottery, in which a few students succeed in getting an attractive internship and that motivates many others to try.  > Why India?

        "answer_body": "  I graduated from a premier Indian university more than a decade ago and have sent out such emails. Let me try to put this practice in context.  Like many universities around the world, Indian universities have a semester system and a three to four month summer break in-between. Many Indian universities (but not the [IITs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institutes_of_Technology)) have a compulsory _summer internship_ that must be completed in the summer before the final year. These internships can be done either in industry or academia. Therefore, it is common for Indian students to apply for internships. Until the late 1990s, most students used to apply for such internships within India.  The situation changed in the late 1990s because a couple of European universities (EPFL for sure, but I think that there were others as well) started a _summer internship program for Indian students_ (almost exclusively from the IITs). The primary reason was to attract Indian students for graduate studies; at that time most Indian students went to English speaking countries. I participated in such a program in the early 2000s.  These programs did not result in any mass emails. The department of the Indian university used to send a list of student CVs, and the department at the European school would select from that list.  However, once students realized that European universities accept students for internships, they started applying en mass. And _most_ , if not all, of them got offers, typically from universities in Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Spain, and Singapore; but also occasionally from the US and UK. (At least, this was the situation at my time). Initially, only IIT students were doing this; slowly everyone else also started applying.  At our time, some of us applied because we wanted to experience the research environment in Europe, others applied because they wanted a paid vacation. Some were meticulous in their search and wrote personalized letters; others simply sent out a form letter to everyone. My understanding is that most students (at least from IITs) still get such internships, so the practice continues.  Note that the universities which started this practice to attract Indian students were successful. They saw an increase in the number of students from IITs who applied for graduate studies. I have friends who went to study in a non-anglophone European country because someone had gone to the same university for an internship and had had a positive experience.  I don't know if more European universities have started this practice or not; but I know that recently Canadian universities (rather a Canadian funding agency) started a university internship program for international students from India, China, and Brazil.

        "answer_body": "  **Tl;dr:** Few people genuinely want to do research internships at universities unless they are academically oriented. Successful students\u2019 stories spread around. Juniors under pressure to land an internship emulate/copy templates. Despite sound advice from seniors, a lot of undergraduates send spam.  * * *  As an undergraduate senior currently studying at IIT Bombay, let me try to add to the already written answers by Aditya etc. with reference to my interaction with my seniors and peers. As has been mentioned in [Aditya\u2018s answer](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/41734/7734), there are some formal channels to get internships; these are mostly helpful for top-ranking students, whereas the number of students wanting to do internships is much more.  At IIT Bombay, there is no mandatory internship requirement for graduation but I know other universities where this is the case. As far as I understand, students, especially juniors (and to a lesser extent sophomores) are under quite some pressure to land a \"summer internship\" and the order of preference is typically as follows: Great company > Average company > Foreign University > Indian University > Current University \u226b Nothing.  For students who are interested in entering the job market after graduating, the order follows naturally, where the last few inequalities stems from peer pressure and the last one from \u201csomething is better than nothing\u201d.  For academically-oriented students \u2013 primarily aiming to apply to grad schools abroad the next year \u2013 the first two options are not relevant. Here, the internship serves three purposes:    * Doing decent/good work ensures a letter of recommendation for grad school from a Professor who is not from your current university (the general belief is that such a LOR is likely to be more helpful than a \u201clocal\u201d one).    * Research experience helpful for deciding fields of interest.    * As somebody as already pointed out, free vacation in a foreign country.  Of course, the relative importance of each factor varies from individual to individual.  In the fall semester, there are often short sessions organized by student bodies on \u201ctips on landing an internship\u201d from successful seniors; I have attended a few of these. The common summary usually boils down to: if you are interested in some professor\u2019s research write a short email with:    * short introduction;   * research you are interested in (after reading papers);   * previous research/study experience with linked/attached homepage/CV.   Although all our seniors strongly advise us against writing fake emails (like the ones you\u2019ve mentioned) as it hurts the reputation of the student community and especially affects those who write sincerely, there are inevitably more than a few who feel desperate (because statistics of landing an internship via emailing are so low), skip over the \u201creading papers\u201d bit and choose to send spam in bulk rather than a few well-thought emails. And inevitably, one \u201cideal\u201d email gets shared which is copied and edited as a template. This leads to a \u201crace to the bottom\u201d as pointed out in [the answer by Anonymous Mathematician](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/41693/7734).  Apart from the statistical factor, there is an obvious mental cost of writing a genuine email; posting spam takes little to no effort compared to writing a sincere email \u2013 I remember having written exactly one email which took me around two weeks including reading papers, references etc.  A short reply to Pete L. Clark\u2019s comment:  > If faculty members really wanted their students to do internships abroad, > why aren\u2019t they helping them out in some way?  Many students have little to no experience with undergraduate research and are looking to land an internship quickly. Professors do occasionally help students get such an internship abroad; this happens mostly in the case where the student has prior undergraduate research experience **and** is comfortable talking about the situation with the professor.

I get responses back such as \"Do some iOS stuff with \"Bob\"\" Whenever I sit down to work, I really don't have an idea on what he's expecting so its hard to put in any meaningful hours.  Extremely low pay for what I am doing, the technologies I am working with are not simple and I am getting paid about 1/5 what I would if I was at a company. I know this is an academic position but it's hard to be motivated knowing I'm getting low pay.  The project I am working on seems to be some project that has been hanging around and he is just trying to produce \"results\" with the grant money.  Overall I just have no interest continuing to work with this professor. What is the best way to tell that to him?  ",

I've developed quite an interest in social network analysis and machine learning and have, thus, been working on research papers that lie within these two categories. However, while I am certain that I enjoy the research experience and can communicate this effectively in my Statement of Purpose, I am worried about the _quality_ as well as low number of publications that I expect to have by the time I apply for an MS/MS-PhD program.  I say quality because I have not published in any of the top-notch CS journals. Two of my papers have been published in conference proceedings (Publisher: Springer). The third paper is actually a book chapter published in IGI-Global. However, two of these papers have only two authors with me as first author and my mentor as second author.  Apart from this, my grades are pretty high. Overall, 9.5/10.0 gpa as of now and I expect to keep this constant by the time I graduate. (If it matters, I scored a 10.0/10.0 one semester and so ranked first in the Uni for that sem.) Taking all this into consideration, is it reasonable for me to target the top 20-50 universities even with my 3 \"okay\" papers? I was hoping that my grades may offset this.

        "answer_body": "  The general answer to your question is, there are no expectations per se. Although your question is phrased in terms of undergraduate research, your explanation focuses mostly on visibility in the form of publications. By parts and based on my own experience:    1. Undergraduate research: This is highly desirable, importantly because it's the best way to get an in-depth letter of recommendation. Letters are the most underestimated factor in admissions by students. The difference between a letter from someone we know describing at length your qualifications and a letter essentially re-stating that you got an A+ in a large class is _very_ significant. Another reason why undergraduate research may be important is because it may give your statement of purpose more focus. Last but not least, it's always desirable to get a student that knows what he/she is getting into and that can hit the ground running.    2. Publications: If you have a publication in a top-tier venue, that is of course an excellent thing to have. A publication in a low-tier venue won't count for much by itself; its significance will depend on, you guessed it, what your adviser's letter says about your contribution.  Ultimately, I think the questions you want answered are:    1. Will someone with undergraduate research experience and a very strong package (including letters of recommendation), but no publications, be competitive in CS? My answer is **Yes**.    2. Could such an applicant lose over someone identical but with some low-tier publications? My answer is, these two applicants would probably be considered essentially equally.    3. Alternatively, could such an applicant lose over someone identical but with one or more publications in top-tier venues? My answer is **Yes, IF** they are competing for a single spot--which is unlikely. Also, such kind of applicants are not at all the norm in my experience (which could vary by area).  In any case, it probably can't hurt for you to engage in research that aims at publishing at a top-tier venue: When you shoot for the moon, even if you miss it, you often end up among stars.  "

I'll be honest: with some professors I never got over being nervous. But to a person, they remembered me, respected me, and helped me get into graduate school because they saw that I cared enough to read over their lecture notes, the text books, and to write down good questions to bring them to their office hours.  Confidence comes with time, sometimes not until graduate school or you are a professsional in your field, frankly. What is important is gaining competence, and knowledge, and experience.

I'm a second year student currently studying mathematics at a Canadian university and as of now, I have two Cs (one in a math course) and an F on my transcript (thankfully, from a non math course). I'm very worried about how this will hurt my application to grad school (in terms of getting research experience and my transcript itself), particularly as a MSc candidate. I know I have a lot of time to make up for my mistakes (academically) this semester, but the way I see it, I'm pretty much out of options until maybe next year when my GPA (currently sitting at ~3.4-3.45) goes up, considering a lot of research opportunities at my school are based on GPA.  I am very interested in pursuing research in some areas of pure mathematics. However, like I mentioned earlier, I know for a fact my school operates research grants and applications based on GPA and seniority, thus because I:    1. Am a second year student and do not have many higher level maths courses under my belt and;    2. Have a mediocre GPA and;   3. Have received lower marks for second year courses rather than first...  it is highly likely I will get rejected by the professors at my school and not get the grant.  My question now is **what else can I do** to help me gain experience/skills/contacts within the department at my school? My lackluster grades were a result of poor time management and I know I can do better. When I asked a similar [question](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/60720/as-a-2nd-year- undergraduate-what-should-i-do-to-enhance-my-maths-grad-school-ap), I was recommended to seek professors to do informal reading with. I am still planning on doing that, however, is there anything else that I can do? I was hoping to ask one of my profs, but I ended up doing much worse in his course than I expected, so I don't know if contacting him would be reasonable anymore?  Anyway, this is a question mostly to see what I can do to redeem myself more than anything. I still have two more maths courses this coming semester I have the chance to do well in, and so far this C would be my lowest maths-related mark yet. Hopefully that doesn't completely take my out of the running.  Thanks in advance for all your help.  ",

A big reason for this is that doing research consumes a _lot_ of resources: time, attention, mental energy, etc.  At my university, students who don't have a certain minimum GPA aren't eligible for department-funded research positions. The reason for this is that it's not in the students' best interest - if they're _already_ doing poorly in their coursework, doing research at the same time is liable to make things a lot worse.  > My lackluster grades were a result of poor time management and I know I can > do better.  Great. That's what you need to do, in order to gain access to research opportunities in later semesters: show that you _can_ manage your time, _can_ excel in your coursework, and that a professor who takes you on as a research assistant isn't going to have to worry about you ending up on academic probation because you can't juggle it all.  For grad school applications, too, showing (by means of excellent grades in later years) that you have more than recovered from your not-so-great sophomore year will be important.  I'm not in mathematics myself, but it's my impression that mathematics (more so than most other fields) requires a lot of prerequisite knowledge before you can do meaningful research. Thus, without having done well in your coursework, including higher level courses, it is unlikely that you will be able to do meaningful research. (Even if you have done higher level coursework, some mathematicians on this site consider undergraduate research experiences to be more \"experience\" than \"research,\" anyways.) See for example [Is it common for an undergraduate thesis in pure mathematics to prove something new?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/49595/is-it-common-for-an- undergraduate-thesis-in-pure-mathematics-to-prove-something).

Research experience is great and often necessary for graduate applications, but it's useless if you don't have good grades in upper-level classes. Focus on showing that you can do well in courses before worrying about adding research to your workload.  Also, excelling in an upper-level class is the probably the best way to connect with a professor and get a research opportunity at this point. If you can get to know a professor a little through class and office hours and impress them there, then it's much easier to ask them after the class is over about research opportunities. The key, however, is that you have to actually impress them, and no professor is going to be impressed by a C or even a B in their class.  It also helps if you are willing to work as an unpaid research assistant or similar. Getting funded positions as an undergraduate can be very difficult, especially in math since it's unlikely you will do any real work. But unpaid positions can still be very valuable and are much easier to obtain.  "

For the summer, programs such as REUs can help broaden your perspectives. These are also nice because they give you money and a chance to work with other interesting students. However, another common option is to find a professor, say at your university, willing to work with you over the summer on a reading course or a research project (possibly informally). Several of our faculty do this semi-regularly (I usually travel in the summer, though I've done it a couple of times), sometimes with a group of students, so try asking around in your department.  I personally think reading courses are just as good, if not better than, most undergrad research projects because at your stage the most important thing is to learn a lot of math. While you can just read things on your own, a professor's guidance can be quite valuable. Also it will provide an opportunity for you to get a more meaningful letter of recommendation, which is very helpful in applications.  "

The thing is, I didn't do well in the class and I didn't get around to finishing the project to it's fullest potential and so I never got back to him (the math prof) about it because I was too embarrassed.  I'm really paranoid now even when I'm just in the building he works in and it sucks because I'm a mathematics student so I'm there a lot. I don't want to run into him or his grad student because I don't want them asking me about the project. The semester's over now and I don't even know if he'd remember me.  I just feel like I've let him down and I really do want to work on the project I just didn't understand what equations and stuff to use after so it was just a mess by the end. Anyway, I'm just wondering what I should do about this? Should I email him? Should I just avoid him? I may want to work with him for research but I don't want him to remember this cliff hanger relationship.  Thanks!  ",

It is likely that he does not care about your classes, and does not know when you are supposed to finish your project, so if you come back to him a few months late he might not even notice.  One way of dealing with your problem would be to set up a \"chance meeting\" - which shouldn't be too difficult, as you know (or can easily find out) when and where the professor lectures, attends talks or whatever. Then ask, whether you could come to him to talk about your project. Most mathematicians are happy about every student who wants to talk about mathematics, so if you manage to move the focus from \"assignment for a specific class\" to \"math problem you are interested in\", you should get an appointment almost instantly.

This got me thinking that perhaps my previous question was going in the wrong direction.  I have >300 students in 3 different subjects. 200 of those students are in one subject and that subject requires students to do extensive research. My challenge (explained in the question linked above) is that I seem to have too little time to properly support this many students.  These are business students so there is no lab. The research is reading the literature, finding data, integrating the two into some meaningful insight.  So, my question is, **when supervising undergraduate students who are doing research, how much time on average, per week, per student, should this consume of the supervisor's time?** 15 minutes? 30 minutes? 1 hour?  **Edit:** To put this in perspective, the students are not writing a bachelor thesis. However, they are expected to put in about 100 hours of non-class time (after the class time has finished) doing their research and writing it up. The final product is about 4,000 - 5,00 words (so far less than a thesis).  ",

This sounds more like a term paper with a research component than 200 fully-fledged research projects. When I did undergraduate research, it was a 20-hour per week job that I got paid for, and even then my supervisor and I rarely met for more than half an hour per week.  There are only 168 hours _total_ in one week, and only 40 working hours in a week. If you spent your _entire_ job meeting with all of the students every week, you could give them 12 minutes each. This is clearly impossible. 200 students is so many that giving them each a 30-minute kickoff meeting to discuss their initial idea at the beginning of the semester would take you two and a half _weeks_. This would put some students at a serious disadvantage over others by potentially delaying their project start or leaving them confused about what is required of them.  If these are not much more than a term paper, then one person can probably do this by putting the assignment together on paper or in email and only answering questions during normal office hours. These kinds of assignments have clearly articulated goals and guidelines and apply techniques as laid out in lectures and homeworks. If you want a more substantial, independent project, then you need TA support, at least 6 and as many as 20 TAs to cover 200 students.  "

My experience is in mathematics and computer science, which may be different from other fields.    * When I wrote my PhD, I usually met with my advisor for about 1-2 hours each week, unless there was a special reason to have a second meeting.     * I work at a department with a master's program. When supervising a master's thesis, I expect to meet with my advisee for about the same amount of time, about 1-2 hours a week, unless there is a reason to meet a second time.    * Similarly, when I co-authored a paper with a strong undergraduate student last year, we met for about 2 hours a week for a semester and a half. Part of this was instruction by me about the area, and part of it was research meetings to engage with our problem.    * When I advise an undergraduate \"senior project\", I set up a meeting for one hour per week with each student I advise. These projects are \"research light\" at my institution, and can even be expository for some students. But at least one senior projects I have supervised developed into a different co-authored paper, so some real research is done as well.   In every case, I expect the student to work for several hours between each of our meetings. When they are writing, I require them to send a draft at least s day before we meet, so I can review it. When they are writing computer code, I also require them to send that a day before we meet as well. This helps me keep the meetings productive - we can talk about challenges they have encountered in the research, or about my feedback on their work, or about future plans, etc., with a minimal amount of wasted time during the meetings.  Each time I have a meeting with a student, I try to make a plan before it begins about what we will talk about. Of course, if the student has something more pressing to discuss, that takes precedence over my plans. But I try not to waste and meeting, because that leads to having to meet again that week or to slipping deadlines, both of which I want to avoid if possible.  Of course, you cannot possibly meet for one hour each week with 200 students. I find the even four personal meetings per week is more than enough to keep me occupied - both in terms of time and in terms of mental capacity. So you will need to find a way to economize, and give less personal attention. You might try organizing group peer review sessions.  Frankly, I am surprised you can even grade the 200 papers that are written - if you can manage 30 minutes per paper all day long that is still over 2 weeks of grading!  If you have any say at the department, you might propose having the students work in groups; 50 groups of 4 is much more appealing than 200 groups of 1, both for advising and for grading.  "

[ **Added** : I just looked this up, and apparently this phrase is quite common in parts of the anglophone world outside of North America. Sorry.]  2) You wrote  > I was hoping that I was going to work on something productive, like a > research project.  That is a very reasonable expectation for a volunteer internship. However, the parameters of the job seem to be very different:  > I'm a trainee in the lab where programming lessons are held with lots of > computers available for the students.  But that doesn't sound research-related at all: it sounds like you're in a **teaching lab** , not a research lab. If you were actually doing the training, you'd be some kind of TA...without pay. Unfortunately:  > On the contrary, my supervisor...constantly assigns chores to me (cleaning, > being his personal mailman on the university etc).  Having to clean up a laboratory space _after using it_ is very reasonable. In my branch of the academic world at least (North America), cleaning up after other people is a paid job, not part of an internship. Similarly, mail delivery is the sort of thing for which someone is usually paid an hourly wage. If you are doing some of this and some of something else, it might be okay if the something else were especially attractive and rewarding. But given that you're not, it sounds to me that you're simply being exploited. Certainly I would feel that way if I were you.  > Yet, he only has one paper, published 20 years ago.  Yikes. So the professor is probably not even **research-active** , or at least not to the level necessary for it to be plausible that he is the head of some kind of research team. He is not a good choice to supervise your research. In view of everything else you've said, I'm afraid that it seems likely that the business about your having a \"proper foundation\" -- especially in the context of his willful ignorance of the skills that you already have -- is just an excuse.  I would go to this professor and say that there's been a misunderstanding. You thought you were getting involved in a research internship, and as it hasn't panned out that way, you'd like to give notice. If he wants to change your mind, have him mention not just the prospect of future research \"when you're ready\", but actually nail down research that you can get started on right away.  It would also be good to speak to at least one of the other faculty members you've mentioned. I don't know where in the world you're writing from, so it's possible that your local academic culture is very different from mine.

Well, I have increased my gpa, from 2.5 to 3.5 but now I see that I need research experience to be admitted to good programs. ( I can't afford masters program)  I thought I didn't need a research experience, yet while I was thinking that, I see that undergraduate students all over the world were doing research. I admit I was naive to think so but I was guided that way. So few months ago I am trying to learn about admission process and I see many people over the internet with tons of research experience and even papers waiting to be published, or already published. And the most important part of SOP is research experience.  And guess what? There is no lab at my university. And not a single instructor that does research in the field I want. It is a very small department (5 full time assistant professors).  So obviously, I cannot get into a top or very good program with these conditions, and they have every right to decline me. But I believe it is my right to get into a good valid program that matches my interests. I shouldn't take the whole responsiblity of non existent opportunities that other students had in other universities.  I would like to know, from experienced people, about what I should do to get into a Ph.D. program without direct proof of research capabilities. No lab work, no research, nada. Just reading many papers in the field I am interested in for last few months, and high motivation.  Or is it a point where I should say \"That's life and never fair\" and have plan B and plan C?

Even if you did gain entry into such a program, you will lack the research skills of your peers. You'll be starting off on the back foot.  A PhD is a long-term commitment to poorly paid slave labour. What if you find out you don't even like research, 1 year in? I would strongly advise the \"try before you buy\" approach. Get a Master's degree or a postgraduate diploma, that has a reasonable research component.  A good PhD program will want you to prove that you have the commitment and research skills to pull it off. Once you can do that, you have a good chance for admission. If research experience is a _requirement_ , then you can't just shrug it off.  "

I have been active in analysing the academic market for a while now, and I used to think that it was necessary for Graduate students to go to to a tier 1 institution in their respective field, if they wanted to one day have a TT position in a respected university. While it doesn't hurt to do so, you should apply to more programs, that may not be ranked so high, but trust me, if you do well, you will have an equal chance to everyone else to get a TT position (tenure track position) at a respected university. Apply to programs such as ERAU (PhD ECE) or UA. Take on a research interest that is big right now, such as Radar Signal Processing, Electromagnetics, Big Data, Cyber Security, and do well in it. As one who is actively involved in advising and has talked to students, faculty, etc., as well as my own experience, you will be just fine. If you are going to only try for a tier 1 school, then it may be more competitive obviously, but in my humble opinion, is not necessary. I can tell you one thing, if you get into any PhD program I'm on familiar with institutions in the U.S., and a select few in other countries), in the USA, with a PhD program and research component, and you get your PhD, and you do well, you will be in the same boat as everyone else. If you really want the name, then finish your PhD where you get in, and then do a postdoc for a year or two at a tier 1 institution.  That being said, ERAU, UA, and many other schools, although may not be ranked as high, are excellent institutions that are not necessarily \"easy\" to get into.

They all have value, although it is hard to quantify. In draft papers show you have initiative and signal (but not reliably) some level of creativity and experience. In review papers suggests the same things to a stronger extent as it implies that the work is more mature (a draft could be at any stage of completion).

From the professor's point of view, mentoring a short-term undergraduate student is a relatively low-risk and low-commitment endeavor (compared to taking on a graduate student.) On the other hand, it does require significant investment of time that may never really pay off (the student will probably move on before they become really \"useful\" to the professor.) Some professors do it largely because their department wants to provide undergraduate research experiences to their own students. In this case, they probably won't be interested in outside students. Some professors do it because they enjoy it (I do!) or because it looks good on grant proposals (it does!), and will be more open to undergraduates from outside their institution.

        "answer_body": "  I think this is a very interesting practical question for the experimental sciences. We often have projects that have the need for a bunch of \"menial\" work (e.g., programming in many of my projects, wet lab work in other fields, ...). I think a lot of the existing answers already highlight important issues (I particularly like Dmitry's), but let me chip in some more thoughts.  I think there are basically two angles you need to think about.  **Angle 1: how to explain to students that they can't publish their own work because it will be part of a larger paper, _even though they themselves will not be co-authors of said paper_**  I understand that if this is the situation, it will seem unfair and exploitative to the student. It seems that this is potentially one of these situations that are hard to explain to an \"outsider\" because, well, they actually are not particularly fair if you consider them from the point of view of the student.  I understand that not every tiny contribution to a project warrants co- authorship. I usually use the metaphor of an open source project to explain this to students - a large open source project like the Linux kernel is a collaboration of many, _many_ people, but only those that contribute significantly enough over a longer period of time get to be maintainers (or co-authors). However (and this part is directly relevant to this question), the individual contributions of each contributor always remain their own \"work\" - the maintainers can choose whether or not to use them, but they can _never_ pretend that they actually wrote them. Hence, I would urge you to go away from the mindset that the _\"work of the students is owned by the lab\"_. It isn't. Whatever the student does, it is owned by the student - you can use their work for a publication, but it never becomes \"your\" work. You didn't do it, and you can't ever pretend you did.  As a direct consequence of this, it is also potentially difficult to prevent students from publishing their own research if the only reason against doing it is that it would hamper your own publication plans. As their work is their work, they should be free to publish it if it is strong enough. Practically, I would strive for a compromise. If your \"big\" paper is for instance on the analysis of certain data, and the student wrote the tool to collect the data, you can write a tool paper together with the student in parallel or after the submission of the \"big\" paper. This way nobody can use your tool paper to scoop you on the main paper, and the student still gets his stuff published.  **Angle 2: how to decide whether a student should be a co-author?**  My simple rule of thumb here is that if the student did _anything_ that shows up in the paper, (s)he is in. To reuse the example of above, if the student wrote a tool to collect data, and the tool is never explained (because it is standard or straight-foward how to do this), I would not make her/him a co- author. If there is a section \"Experiment Design\" that describes the tool in any length, (s)he is a co-author. Personally, I have a lenient approach to this - if in doubt, make her/him a co-author, maybe under the requirement that (s)he needs to contribute heavily to the rest of the project.  The most important part is to communicate this early - telling a research undergrad that he _may_ be a co-author, and then, after (s)he dilligently did all her/his work, decide against it is a big letdown. Decide when you define the project whether it will be enough for co-authorship and communicate this clearly.  I feel it is also important here to keep in mind that (at least here) many undergrads are \"in it for the co-authorship\". That is, they are doing free research specifically with the expectation that they will be \"paid\" in a co- authored paper if the project works out (and good letters, of course). This is another reason to communicate early and honestly with a student - giving a student a project that, even if done nicely, will not be sufficient for co- authorship may be perceived as a \"setup\" from their side. That is, they may feel that you really just used them as cheap programming labour, without real chance for them to get what they expected out of it. Telling them then about the things they have learned will not smooth things over anymore.  "

      "question_body": "  I am an undergraduate student in a European University (for privacy reasons, I will not reveal any personal information that may identify me).  I am interested in research, and a month ago - or so - I have contacted a Professor from Department \"X\" at my university, asking whether I could be integrated in any research group at the Department. The Professor set an appointment with me, showed me the installations, the labs, the material, ... I really liked Department \"X\", but their research is not what I was expecting. At Department \"X\", they work on the field that I like, but it's not what I was expecting: here's an analogy - I wanted to study snakes, but instead of actually studying the snakes' behaviour/their genes, at Department \"X\" they study the effect of external factors on snakes.  Still, because at my university I wasn't aware of anyone else studying snakes - or any other animal -, I said I was interested. I've been given a few articles to read, to catch up on the latest news about snakes, and also the methodology to study snakes. She (the Professor) is expecting me to work there soon.  The problem is that I have met a Professor, who works at Lab \"Y\". At Lab \"Y\", their research is top-level, probably one of the best labs in the country. During a talk with the Professor from Lab \"Y\", I mentioned my interest in animals, specially snakes, and the Professor told me about his job at Lab \"Y\". They do not specifically work with snakes, although they also do research on snakes sometimes. The research at this lab is much more specific and they have papers in the best journals in the field (unlike Department \"X\", which - although their research is not that bad - is much inferior to Lab \"Y\").  Now I am not sure what to do. I feel like I am obligated to work at Department \"X\" - after all, I have made a commitment with them. Furthermore, because it's a department from the university, it is close to me, I can go there in my free time easily, and I actually hope I will be able to teach a few classes about snakes if I stay with them. However, if I choose Lab \"Y\", I will be in another environment, where top-level research is made. On the other hand, the lab is around 1 hour (by public transports) from my house (it is not at the university).  For that reason, I would like to hear some advice from experienced academics like you.  ",

Now, it should be pointed out that even though you've made a commitment to Prof. X's lab, if you choose to honor it (and personally, I would lean toward doing so), it should also be noted that such a promise does not mean you are committed to work in Prof. X's lab exclusively. It is entirely common for undergraduates to bounce around between different positions until they find something they like. Most faculty understand this, and so it shouldn't be a big deal in the long run if you decide to work in Prof. X's lab for six months to a year before trying out Prof. Y's lab.  "

I have been reading recent papers published by two of my professors who I admire and I'm wondering what it would be like to conduct research with them. In what ways can an undergraduate student contribute to mathematical research? In what ways could I prepare myself to conduct mathematical research?  To be more specific, my academic background is in History and Social Sciences which I studied intensely from High School through my first two years in college. I conducted research at University of Arizona my junior year of high school analyzing a large set of longitudinal data on a group of high schools in NYC. My interest in math, specifically applied math, started when I took a Computer Science class because I was curious. Since then, I've taken calculus courses, applied combinatorics, probability courses, and I'm currently enrolled in a computational geometry course and an operations research course. The reason I'm interested in pursuing undergraduate mathematical research is because I enjoyed the experience a lot when I was studying social sciences. My concern is that I don't have a strong enough background to contribute to the research my professors currently conduct. I get good grades in my classes, but I'm concerned with my lack of background for a Junior in an applied math major. Recent publications from my professors are difficult for me to understand, so I'm questioning whether I'm ready to conduct research with them. I'm hoping you may be able to offer insight into whether my background is sufficient for conducting research and how I may be able to strengthen my skills. I take my school work seriously and think I have a good understanding of the material I'm taught. Thank you for your time.  ",

Some people are fond of claiming that somehow \"just trying hard\" or \"being smart\" can make this possible in some way, but those are needless (and doubtful) claims that miss the mark about what the real question could be.  That is, many or most faculty are happy to mentor beginners and introduce them to the subject(s) the faculty know and like. It need not be the case that they \"need help\", and, if they did, sure, recruiting novices is not the best gamble. But that's not the point! The point is that experts may _enjoy_ (and find stimulating) introducing beginners to their subject. So you help them by allowing them to do so.  It's not at all surprising that you have trouble reading their recent papers, and, again, that's essentially irrelevant. (The internet mythology about young people becoming world experts in a few weeks or months is invidious... In particular, no, you should not expect to \"read those papers and then go talk to them about them.\", contrary to much advice given on-line.)  An astute expert can find interesting \"starter\" projects for novices. It may happen that such a project produces something interesting to the expert. Or, it may be that the expert can so well foresee the outcome that the element of surprise evaporates. But that doesn't matter. Little kids don't have to immediately play sports (or whatever) with world-class professionals. But they can be coached by such professionals, if both parties are interested. I do think that's the correct analogy, though many other people on these sites are adamant otherwise.  "

The following represents my vision on the topic and definitely is not an absolute truth. However, I believe and hope that many people would agree with my point of view. In my mind, education and research in educational setting, including writing a thesis (dissertation) seeks to **enable** a future scholar to perform research and, perhaps, teach. That is, the goal is to immerse a person in an _experience_ and teach them a _framework_ for approaching problems and finding solutions to those problems (gaining specific knowledge is a valuable, but secondary goal). That experience and that framework are much more important than anything else one can learn in an academic environment. As the famous Chinese proverb says,  > _Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you > feed him for a lifetime._  Obviously, this wisdom should be understood in the academic context, but both essence and value of this idea remain as valid in academia as they do in other contexts. Moreover, from the perspective of mastering the scholarly framework, I think that it is much more important to ask the right questions (and, perhaps, ask any questions, as IMHO there no wrong or bad questions), than to obtain results or, even, good results. In my view, _asking questions_ that lead to obtaining results is paramount to becoming a good scholar and represents an essential part of the above-mentioned scholarly framework. Speaking of importance to science of asking questions and, generally, being curious (versus focusing on results), another famous phrase of a famous scholar comes to mind:  > _I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious._ \u2013 Albert > Einstein  Considering all the arguments, mentioned above, and returning to your specific question, I would say that it is completely wrong to gauge quality of a thesis (or graduate's achievements, in general) by research results. Not only results are _not an indicator_ of said quality or achievements, but also \"bad results\" are as _valuable_ , if not more, as the \"good\" ones. For more information on the value of _negative results_ (for studies with formulated _hypotheses_ ), please see [my other answer](https://academia.stackexchange.com/a/46306/12391). Good luck!  "

Measures like _not allowing_ to post duplicates are not implemented; nor a recommender that helps users choose the most appropriate site, or ask better questions. This puts the burden on the frequent users and moderators to keep the site useful. At the same time, duplicates and low-quality questions do cause rude comments and answers in the first place. Solving this properly _would_ likely make the tone much nicer.   2. Migration of questions is a complicated procedure, rather than simply making the different sites \"views\" on the same underlying data. There is a random set of migrations that can be proposed (such as SO to stats.SE), but no way to propose others (e.g., to DS.SE) They are making our lives harder than necessary.   3. We can't flag duplicates of questions on other SE sites, even if there is a perfect duplicate.   4. The company wastes tons of money on stupid things such as WinterBash, and on projects doomed to fail such as \"SO Documentation\" and \"SO for Teams\". I understand that you need to generate more revenue, but you should listen to your users (in particular to avoid _costly_ failures such as documentation).   5. **The company does not listen to their users.** A recent example is the [Monica incident](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/340906/update-an-agreement-with-monica-cellio). This lawyeresque statement shows what is wrong: they fight their best users. But there are many more examples. \"User surveys\" that sound like they come from the sales department, not from user support; that avoid any of the big issues such as duplicates, low quality questions, and the resulting sometimes rude handling of such questions; and many more.   6. I do want to emphasize that I am in general **in favor of a \"code of conduct\"** , and I do strongly believe we need to fight for diversity. I am all in favor of using stated pronouns, but I know that I would get them wrong often. I have not seen any of the transcripts, so I have no idea what Monica did, but we also all have heard of false accusations, mistakes, and so on. I do not think the situation was handled well by SO staff, and it only got worse and worse. A code of conduct that are community standards should actually come from the community, and be handled by the community, not by some higher entity like the company.   7.

That means that you will have to contact professors (even if that means contacting tens of them), and ask them if they would be willing to consider bringing you on for that long. Obviously, you will need to offer them something, like strong computing skill (which will really distinguish you). As I looked at your profile, it seems like you do have a strong computing skill, and so I would advertise that. Another great option (which I did in my previous life), was join the IT department of a specific academic department, and slowly find the opportunity to network with faculty and let them know regarding your skills.

The first Professor gave you an opening. If you follow through on his advice, you have a means to build a relationship with the guy. Mentors actually love it when others take their advice (since it doesn't happen as often as they'd like). So if the advice seems worth pursuing, go for it. Just think of it like a friendly game of tennis. It's only fun when the other player is able to return the ball back to you. So return that ball (if you think it's worth it) and keep the exchanges going.  As to the second Professor, there are other ways you can get feedback from him. And you're right, email is horrible if the guy doesn't know you already.  If he's located in your general geographical area, you should drop by his office. If that Professor can associate a face to the email, it's much more likely he'll take your email much more seriously.  Another thing you can do is frequent the same mailing lists and the same discussion forums this Professor contributes to (assuming you can guess which ones they are). If you become familiar with his research and his computer science-related interests, that's another way to grab his attention. If you provide good feedback on some of his ideas/projects/posts/code, he will most likely do the same for you in return if you ask him.  And by the way, do not fake an interest in his research. Study his research/interests until you're genuinely interested. People can smell fake enthusiasm. So don't fake it if you're not really interested.  And finally, don't be afraid to ask for referrals to other academics if a particular Professor reads what you have to say, but is not interested. The only reason I'm not suggesting you do that for the first Professor is because you don't seem to know him and he does seem interested. He just thinks that your project should be going in a different direction, so he's not likely to refer you even if you ask him (without you first incorporating his initial feedback into your project).

In practice, there seem to be two key differences in how they are treated:    1. Panel members can be a little more forgiving for certain aspects of RUI proposals. For example, if the PI publishes excellent papers but not very many of them, then this low publication rate would probably be considered a bigger drawback in a non-RUI proposal.    2. The NSF may give some degree of preference to a few RUI proposals, as described below.  The review panel classifies proposals into three categories: roughly 10% that are highly recommended for funding, 30-40% that are recommended for funding, and 50-60% that are not. The available funding is never sufficient to cover all the proposals recommended for funding, so further decisions need to be made after the panel.  The ones not recommended for funding are automatically eliminated, and the ones highly recommended for funding are more or less guaranteed to be funded. The ones in the middle are ranked in order by the panel, but the NSF is not required to follow this ranking. They largely follow it, but they adjust it based on their own criteria (for example, balance of fields, geographical diversity, etc.). My understanding is that if no RUI proposal in a given panel would otherwise be funded, then the highest-ranked RUI proposal may be bumped up in the rankings. However, this is not guaranteed, and it depends on having a high enough ranking from the panel. The program officers may also compare how panels in different areas ranked their RUI proposals, to see which ones seem most worthy of funding. However, there is no RUI-only panel.  "

Sometimes some of the NRFP proposals are classified as Low Competitive (but still immediately discarded). Highly competitive proposals are usually, but not always funded. Some (approx. one third) of Competitive proposals are funded. Total funding (acceptance) rates (e.g., for III) are typically around 15 percent, sometimes a bit higher (up to 20%) for Early Career proposals. Funding rates in Computer Science vary widely across programs, solicitations, size classes, divisions, year submitted, etc. ranging from 10% to 50% (depending on budgets, number of proposals submitted, etc.) In general funding rates decline with increasing size (budget) class of the proposals.  RUI proposals are considered together with other proposals but treated somewhat more leniently. Proposals from all of the review panels for a particular cluster (group), e.g., III in IIS Division of the CISE directorate, for a particular solicitation (and size class) are considered together when making funding decisions.

        "answer_body": "  There is 2 parts to this question:  **(1) How valuable are conference papers to grad school admission?**  The answer to that is field-dependent. In some fields, the value of conferences as means of publishing scientific content is perceived small. In others, primarily Computer Science, conferences are of major importance, hence papers in good conferences are perceived as _very_ valuable for admission.  However, arguably, even in fields were conference papers count less, having published in and attending good conferences may make you stand out of the crowd in grad school admissions. Primarily, in these fields (e.g., physics), undergrads that have good _journal_ papers to their name are very rare, so having been to a conference _as an undergrad_ is already pretty good, even if it does not count for all that much in the grand scheme of things in the research field.  **(2) Is it worth it given that conferences are very expensive?**  I am of course generalising here, but as a rule of thumb, you should _not_ have to pay for your own conference travels, as long as you have an accepted paper as an enrolled student. Most universities have stipends and travel grants that you can apply for, you can act as a student volunteer, or, most importantly, your university department covers your travel expenses.  Assuming that it is indeed not feasible for you to have your costs covered, you will need to take the decision yourself. Whether it's \"worth it\" depends not only on the value of a conference to the admission process, but also on how much >1000 USD are to you, personally. Clearly, the story is different if you are a foreign student living of a small stipend than if you come from an upper middle-class family in the US.  "

If your deceit is discovered, you are likely to lose your degree, and may possibly face other consequences. (For example, if you have a job based on that degree, you may lose the job when the degree is revoked.)  It is always disappointing when a project doesn't work out the way you hope it will, but there is always that risk when you set out to do something that isn't completely straightforward. See, for example, this related question: [What to do when research leads to poor results?](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/47692/what-to-do-when- research-leads-to-poor-results)  Even experiments that are \"known\" to work (in the sense that someone claims to have previously achieved \"good results\" with that experiment) can't always be repeated reliably. See [Estimating the reproducibility of psychological science](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716), in which the authors attempt to repeat 100 published psychology experiments, and \"replicated the original result\" in fewer than half of them.  The correct response is to write your thesis giving all the details of your work as it happened: the background, the experiment design, and the results. This serves to document your efforts, and may prove to be useful to other people who might try the same experiment in the future. You may also explain _why_ you think the experiment may not have yielded the results you expect, and possibly propose a new experiment (if you have any ideas for improving your work).  Note that even when scientific findings do not match our expectations, the study is still considered a success (of sorts) if we can learn something from it. Even if what we learn is \"this experiment does not yield consistent results in many cases.\" In contrast, false results might look nice, but are worse than worthless.  A lack of \"good results\" does not necessarily doom your thesis.

You should talk to your supervisor _now_ \\- don't surprise her the week before your submission date and tell her that the experiment failed! Talk to your supervisor and ask for her advice on how to proceed with your experiment.

The basic problem is that it's unclear what it means to have studied a book: there's a huge range of levels of mastery that could all legitimately fall into this category. Furthermore, many undergraduates have trouble accurately assessing their own knowledge and accomplishments, so a self- assessment of mastery is not convincing even if it's completely honest. And of course honesty and bias are important issues.  The net effect is that these claims are vague, subjective, and unverifiable, which is exactly the opposite of what belongs in your CV.  You could always try to say something more precise. For example, \"I wrote out solutions to every problem in Hartshorne's algebraic geometry textbook\" is much more compelling than \"I studied Hartshorne\" or \"I mastered Hartshorne\". It's still not ideal; for example, it leaves open the question of whether your solutions were actually correct. However, it at least gives a much clearer idea of how much you might have learned, and it allows the possibility of verification by requesting to see the solutions. (Don't say this if you lost them!)  I wouldn't recommend trying to make precise claims like this for all your independent reading, since it would still come across as eccentric.

        "answer_body": "  This question brought to my mind two anecdotes:    1. The back cover of Donald Knuth's epic book _The Art of Computer Programming_ famously carries an endorsement quote from Bill Gates [saying](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Computer_Programming#Critical_response) \"If you think you're a really good programmer... read (Knuth's) Art of Computer Programming... You should definitely send me a r\u00e9sum\u00e9 if you can read the whole thing.\"    2. True story: some years ago I was invited to join some colleagues at a conference at lunch, and found myself sitting next to a famous scientist whose classic textbook is a discipline-shaping, notoriously difficult to read work, which has greatly informed and inspired my own research. After some introductions and random smalltalk I turned to him and said something like \"Professor, I thought you should know I really love your book. It has really influenced my research and my thinking.\" He smiled, clearly amused, and after a short pause replied \"Hmm. So what's in chapter 9?\" Of course I was rather taken by surprise, but I did know the book very well and after a few seconds managed to get my wits together and said \"oh, chapter 9 is about [X].\" He was quite pleased and impressed. (I think he did not expect me to know the answer to his question; the joke was that chapter 9 is the most difficult chapter in the book, understood at a high level perhaps by 5-10 people on earth, and certainly not by me. But I did at least know what it was about...)  Going back to the OP's question, I would say that listing books you have mastered in a CV is certainly very unconventional (I have never seen it done), but as my anecdotes illustrate, this information can certainly be valuable to a prospective employer/mentor, so I see no reason why it should be taboo to mention it, subject to the following caveats:  a. Only include the list if you truly believe your private studying of hard topics in mathematics is so extensive compared to that of your peers that it would make you a more attractive internship candidate. Everybody reads books, so your list needs to be able to convincingly demonstrate that you have a read a lot more and understood a lot more than most other internship candidates.  b. Be precise about the level of mastery you have achieved of the books in question. For example, you can include your list under the heading \"Books mastered\" and add a footnote saying \"I have invested at least 40 hours of study in each of the books on the list, and in each one I have solved a large proportion of exercises. My solutions are recorded in a notebook that I keep for future reference.\"  c. Most importantly, be completely honest. **Do not** inflate or exaggerate your claims (and if your list doesn't seem impressive enough without such exaggerations, obviously that means you should not add it to your CV). If I were calling you up for an interview after being impressed by your list -- which I can quite possibly see myself doing -- I would make very sure to ask you (as the famous scientist did to me) some questions about tricky topics in a random sample of the books to test your understanding. Needless to say, if I found out you were exaggerating the interview would be over immediately.  "

Sure, do _not_ say \"mastered\" (even if you believe it, or even if it's true), because you'll simply discredit yourself, so readers won't believe much else in your file.  Since, apparently, self-motivated, undocumentable reading-of-books is not so common in mathematics, there seems to be no accepted tradition of how to report it or even mention it. While it is certainly true that good advice from experienced mathematics faculty can be helpful both in choice of sources and in how to benefit from them, there's simply not enough time in the day for a very-inquisitive person to ask about every thing they see, probably.  There is also a confusing pervasive mythology about \"how\" one should read a source: supposedly ultra-carefully, line-by-line, doing all the exercises, and so on. I do not buy into this, for various reasons. In any case, this at least indirectly would seem to completely invalidate any other notion of \"looking at things\", which I think is a very bad thing. That is, I think \"casual\" (or whatever word we can agree on) reading/skimming/perusal of mathematics books can be very helpful, productive, informative, etc. E.g., getting an idea where all the little details are _going_ , and maybe _why_ we'd care.  E.g., the notion that one would _ONLY_ look at the textbooks for the few math courses one enrolls for each year strikes me as bizarre, comparable to the notion that one would play sports only when signed up for \"gym class\", and then only for \"assignments\". Or only listen to music for \"music appreciation\" class.  In particular, as anyone reading this answer can surmise, when I read an application file that includes self-driven reading outside of the official coursework game, it is a big positive. True, self-appraisal is a difficult thing... but/and that difficulty should not be a reason to disregard the thing that is difficult to assess! After all, the convenience of \"grades\" is substantially self-referential, and often reflects as much obedience as understanding.  So, yes, you might list some books you've \"looked at\", in a form somewhat parallel to listing advanced coursework (which should include textbook authors' names, also!). Be modest. And in mathematics, the authors' names are more explanatory than titles, so it's important to include them.  "

If you don't get a good response from the professors you can always take it to the department or the school employment office.  As to guest lecturing, rather than expecting to come into a class, you could reach out to some of the department's student groups about coming to speak as a way to test the waters. You can always offer to come as a guest lecturer to a class, but devoting a class session to a guest (unless the class already has plans for guest lecturers) means that much material that the class won't get to cover.  Your success will largely depend on your attitude in approaching the people in control, how they remember you and how you present your ideas. You won't have much success if you charge in telling them that their program is \"only good if you want to go to grad school, but crap for going out into industry\" even if that's true.

Casual but nice clothing is definitely appropriate. It won't be a job interview but rather just a friendly discussion. If this is your first meeting about research, it will most likely just be a brief overview of what he does and potentially what a student would be doing. If you decide to do research with him then he most likely have future meetings in which he will discuss things more in depth, give papers to read to begin learning area of research and explain what is expected.  A professor is usually more than happy to discuss their research and take on someone whose interested and determined to conduct research if they have room. That being said, often times the professor would like that you have at least a general idea about what he or she does in their research and areas that interest you. You can expect a question such as, \"What about the work I do stuck out for you and made you want to pursue this?\" as I can recall being asked this more than once. It is also a good idea to have a few questions for them about their research, labs, etc. Again questions don't need to be an in depth inquiry on their research but just some light questions to get to know them and their work.  It's ok to be unknowledgable on the area of research as that's the point of research; to learn about the field and discover new concepts. The important thing is showing the desire to learn. Also you are an undergraduate so it's more expected that you don't have much experience in a research field.  All in all, from my personal experience it's a quick informal discussion with the professor to provide insight to you so you can decide if you want to conduct research with them. I've had nothing but pleasant experiences with this since professors love others interested in their research and I'm sure you will have the same experience! Good luck!  "

So, although a relatively small number of undergraduate math students participate in true \"research\", there are certainly students who are able to make nontrivial discoveries as undergraduates, and more than one might initially think. I have been at prestigious research schools and at anti-prestigious regional universites in the U.S.A. At every school I have been, there were undergraduates in mathematics with the aptitude for publishable research. The talent needed may not be \"common\", but it is certainly not \"rare\". The obstacles are primarily cultural, not intellectual.  The topic of undergraduate research has also been the subject of a [question on MathOverflow](https://mathoverflow.net/questions/45802/undergraduate-math- research), which makes for good reading.  For an example from personal experience: I recently published a peer-reviewed paper in what I consider to be a high-quality journal (and which is not in any way a \"student\" journal), with an undergraduate student co-author, who discovered the proof of one of the main theorems on his own between two of our research meetings.  Another example is the journal _Involve_ , which is devoted to genuine student research. From [their self- description](http://msp.org/involve/about/journal/about.html):  > Involve showcases and encourages high-quality mathematical research > involving students from all academic levels. The editorial board consists of > mathematical scientists committed to nurturing student participation in > research. > > Submissions in all mathematical areas are encouraged. All manuscripts > accepted for publication in Involve are considered publishable in quality > journals in their respective fields, and include a minimum of one-third > student authorship. Submissions should include substantial faculty input; > faculty co-authorship is strongly encouraged. In most cases, the submission > (and accompanying cover letter) should come from a faculty member. > > Involve, bridging the gap between the extremes of purely undergraduate- > research journals and mainstream research journals, provides a venue to > mathematicians wishing to encourage the creative involvement of students.  One thing that undergraduates are unlikely to have is the _breadth of knowledge_ that is expected for PhD recipients. Particularly in mathematics, PhD students are examined in a range of subjects, and are expected to have mastered large parts of the undergraduate curriculum. Undergraduate research often involves learning enough about one particular area to prove new theorems. The student still needs to spend time learning other areas to have the knowledge expected of a PhD.  The real key for undergraduates who are looking to do publishable research is to find a collaboration with a good faculty mentor. _Independent_ research by undergraduates is indeed quite rare (in fact, the majority of mathematics papers currently published have two or more authors - even experts benefit from collaboration). The MathOverflow thread linked above has more advice from other mathematicians.  "

        "answer_body": "  I'm going to disagree with Oswald. In my experience, undergraduate students do not often prove new things in pure math. I wouldn't even say master's theses often contain new results. There are a few main reasons for this.  Firstly, pure mathematics operates at a level that is not very accessible for most undergraduates, even those doing research. Undergraduates doing research are often well out of their depth and holding on for dear life. This can mostly be attributed to just not having enough time to get up to speed with what is considered modern mathematics. Most courses in mathematics at the undergraduate level are about math from 50-100 years ago (if not older).  Secondly, undergraduates do not often have the mathematical experience to know what the right plan of attack is when faced with an abstract and new problem and they may not know how to check their work thoroughly to make sure there are no major oversights or blunders. A lot of mathematics involves lateral thinking and it takes a lot of time to build those connections. The hardest part of a pure math PhD (in my opinion) is learning how to attack a problem no one has considered before. Standard techniques that others used may not be useful at all to you for one reason or another. An undergraduate won't have the creativity to navigate this kind of issue because the kind of creativity that is needed comes with a lot of experience. Even when an undergraduate student thinks they've proved something, the nuances of their argument likely will not be apparent to them. (This is especially true when it comes to functional analytic/measure theoretic arguments - the devil is in the details.) Thus a proposed proof may not even be close to being right.  Lastly, not many undergraduates in pure math do research because the gap they have to overcome between coursework and modern mathematics is pretty substantial. Those that make contributions in pure math are those that are very, very talented and have very thorough backgrounds (backgrounds that rival master's/PhD students).  Undergraduates in pure math are not expected to make contributions. That is not what research is about for them. Introducing an undergraduate to research serves a couple of different purposes: it introduces them to more advanced topics and it gives them a taste of what research is like so that they can make an informed decision about whether or not graduate school is right for them. As such, the theses are more like surveys of a specialized topic in mathematics. There is a lot of independent learning involved and there may be some unique examples, insights, and connections contained therein. They may not be presenting \"original\" work, but poster sessions are there to present what they've learned regardless of whether or not it was original. So yes, it is kind of like a lecture. _They are undergraduates_ and far from being experts in their field.  Note that I am not saying that no undergraduate ever produces new results in pure math (there are some _high school students_ that are better than most PhDs), but it is not a common occurrence and is not expected or considered the norm.

        "answer_body": "  The answers so far contain a yes and a no, so let me add a yes-and-no.  Undergraduates can - and often do - prove new things, but hardly ever anything of importance. It is up to the advisor to find an interesting question which is simple enough to serve as the topic of a thesis, but not yet dealt with in the literature. Different from a Ph.D., a bachelor or master thesis is heavily constrained in time, so as an advisor you should only give a topic if you are pretty certain that something can be done by an unexperienced researcher in short time. On the other hand just repeating the literature is boring for the student. One way to find good topics is to look at what is often referred to as folklore: Every textbook contains the theorem that X implies Y, and every expert knows that quasi-X already suffices, but noone bothered to write it up. This will most probably not be worth a publication, but proving a theorem not yet contained in the literature is motivating. Another simple method is looking at all the things you excluded from your own papers. If you worked out an example, but did not include it in a publication, you can let the student generalize it.  What you should not do is ask a student a problem you are really interested in. First the student will be frustrated, because the problem is too hard for him, then you will be frustrated, because you will spend much more time explaining things to him then you would need to find the results for yourself, and finally everyone is frustrated, because you find an answer and have to explain it to the student.

Raw cleverness has already been exercised, quite systematically, for some hundreds of years (thousands?). People have learned useful things, and to not know these is to not know how to change a tire, or a light bulb, or a furnace filter, or open the door. Not that the usual curriculum helps much, either, I agree! But that does not mean that basic operational skills (involving occasionally subtle mathematics, literally, here) are irrelevant. Getting outside the degenerate \"school math\" thang is excellent... but thinking that that means \"we don't need to know anything!\" is obviously silly... even if appealing. \"Complicated\".  "

I'm studying probability theory.  As a first year student, about half of my time was spent solidifying my mathematical background in probability, measure theory and analysis. I also spent quite a lot of time studying specialised articles, and finally I applied the general theory I studied to a specific problem, where I did prove something \u00ab new \u00bb, while very closely following other published results. On the way there, I also proved a few lemmas, that, while not of general interest, are \u00ab new \u00bb and interesting to me.  Clearly, undergraduate students are not expected to find groundbreaking results of general interest. However, they can contribute to mathematics by summarising and gathering related results from multiple articles, applying new theories, finding examples, etc.  **_A word of advice._**  You should not aim for great discoveries, but rather simply try to do your own mathematics. Ask yourself a lot of \u00ab stupid \u00bb questions and find their answers. That's how you'll end up with a few small new results. Make sure you can grasp the big picture of your field of study, that you look at it from a critical standpoint and that you understand the issues that motivate it.  **_Do math undergraduates frequently prove new things?_**  Yes. But not _great_ things, and sometimes things that might already be known to experts (but not widely accessible). I think that it is good enough for an undergrad to prove things that are new to him/her and her classmates/advisor/etc.  "

Their general travel grants budget may not be the only source of funding available. You might be able to get some funding in exchange for helping with the conference registration desk, for instance.    * If your paper made it into a top tier conference in the US, it is likely it will be accepted at other top tier venues.

For instance, [this](http://chi2013.acm.org/organizers/student-volunteers/) and [this](http://cscw.acm.org/participation_sv.html). This defrays cost of registration (free) and some of your living expenses (food and some cost of living). Apply for it immediately.    2. You mention that you are getting some travel grant from the conference. Thats a good thing. Keep it for airfare.    3. If its a ACM/IEEE conference, it will be sponsored by a SIG. SIGs have their own funding. For instance, see [this](http://www.websci12.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/SIGWEB-StuTravel.pdf) and [this](http://www.podc.org/student-travel/). If you are an ACM/IEEE member then you can apply for these funds which are independent of conferences.    4. Sometimes, in limited ways, industrial research labs and other government labs have funding. Search for and apply for these. For instance, see [this](http://www.siam.org/meetings/da10/mstsupport.php) , [this](http://dbtctep.gov.in/index.php?option=proposal_instructions&proposal_type=50&instruction=1) and especially [this](https://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/global/india/travel_grants.aspx).  I was once a poor student and had to make use of multiple sources of funding to go to conferences. You can also do it ! Basically, apply for everything that you find and see. Of course, the best way is to simply ask another co- author or someone actually visiting the conference to present the paper.  Another way is to just pay the registration fee (which is comparatively less). That way your paper is still indexed in the ACM DL or IEEE Xplore etc.  "

Undergraduates will usually have much less contact with professors than graduate students, because of the sheer numbers of students involved - professors don't have infinite time to meet with each undergrad for an hour every week.  That said, even German professors write letters of recommendation for undergrads once in a while (e.g., for student grants). Usually, they will get their information from the graduate students that _do_ have a lot of contact with the undergrad. For instance, they may ask the grad student to draft the letter of recommendation, then review, improve and sign it. That way, the undergrad gets a recommendation written by someone who actually knows him and may have more time to invest in the letter than a busy professor, and the grad student gets a little experience in writing letters of recommendation (which is a good preparation for later academic life), and everything is done under the supervision of the professor.  Bottom line: your situation is routine. Don't worry. Just do a good job, and your letter will be fine.  "

You _need_ to talk to him, even though it's an uncomfortable situation. Also, you say in a comment:  > Because the general culture in academia tends to be more like, \"Work as many > or as few hours as you want as long as you get your work done.\"  This is true, but you say that he _does not_ get his job done. Frankly, if he only works like 25 hours, even if he would be supremely productive I would _still_ talk to him about his work ethics if he puts in so much less hours than his peers... and if he is not it's all the more reason to make sure that he at least tries as hard as the others.  If you don't, the problem is going to be that sooner rather than later many of the 45-hours students are going to wonder why the heck _they_ are actually not enjoying the summer. I have seen in my current group that various bad habits have a tendency to spread like wildfire if the students have the impression that not doing your job isn't in any way frowned upon anyway.  > If so, how to do it without sounding like a jerk?  In private, without getting emotional or accusatory. Tell him that you have the impression that he works considerably below the amount that was agreed upon, and that you have to ask him to change this. Tell him that you have the impression that his project is not progressing fast enough, and what will happen if he can't get it done in time (you _have_ some course of action in this case, right?). Be prepared that he may counter with some sort of attack against you. For instance, this is a classic in such situations: _\"Well, since you never have time for me, I don't know what to do half of the time anyway - so rather than just sit around I leave\"_. Make sure that you have a good answer in this case.  "

        "answer_body": "  From the perspective of an undergrad student, I think you should address this issue. He might be unaware of the problem you are having with him since as you said, he is not behind in his work but you feel he could be more productive. He might even appreciate you telling him this if framed correctly, allowing him to pinpoint where he can improve and knowing that his advisor not only notices his performance but believes he can do better.  Mention that it is a paid full-time position and because of that there are expectations, despite the culture you mentioned in one of your comments. He might be able to get work done in the amount of hours a week he works, but increasing his hours not only ensures his work is done, it also shows his dedication. Also mention that the project is _designed_ for someone to work 35 to 40 hours a week. He is not especially productive during his 25 hours a week, so it's not like he can get away with doing less than expected.  Sounding like a jerk would only be a problem, I think, if you don't explain your reasoning for talking to him about this. It might be best to address this in an informal setting outside of the lab, but that is more about where you personally think the conversation would be least confrontational. The way you approached the wording of the question definitely made you sound well intentioned and not jerk-ish in the slightest, so you shouldn't worry too much about your tone.  I would suggest asking him if he is only working 25 or so hours a week because he has other things going on in his personal life. It's a good place to start the conversation as it is coming from a place of concern and allows for you to get to your main problems with him as well. I'm assuming that the schedule is somewhat flexible, and if that is true, remind him of that and that you're willing to work with his schedule to some extent.  "

It's possible, if he isn't putting in his full effort, that he isn't very interested in the research project (maybe he had misconceptions as to what research was like in general, or found out that he isn't as interested in the field as he thought he was). I'm not sure if there's a lot you could do there. Perhaps he's lost sight of how his particular project fits into the big picture. I had that problem before, and feeling like I was an insignificant cog in the research machine certainly didn't help my performance (I found it helpful to discuss the research with my professor to revitalize my interest in the project and to get a better understanding of how my work fit in and was useful to the team).  On the other hand, it's possible that he is having some difficulties that are holding him back with his work that are discouraging him. Is it possible that there would be unforeseen issues with his project that would make it take more time than you thought? (Admittedly this is more unlikely--I and many of my coworkers would be inclined to work more hours at this point, but it can be disheartening I suppose).  If you want to avoid directly telling him to work more hours, consider increasing the frequency at which the students report their progress to you if necessary. Perhaps have them do a mini presentation every week on what they've accomplished. Some people find it difficult to keep slacking off if they feel like their slacking is making them look like they don't have much to show.  If you do choose to speak to him directly about his work hours, just be honest --he's being paid for full time work, so he needs to work full time. That's really not something a student who wants to learn would be offended by (perhaps he'd take a hit on his pride, but that's hardly your fault).  If you want to be less \"in your face\", perhaps you could get this point across by emphasizing that the summer is almost over, and so he should be giving it his all in the last few weeks. This should be especially easy if you plan on having one-on-one time with the students to discuss their progress. It could be something as simple as  \"Hi there [student]. Based on your current progress with your project, I would strongly encourage you to spend more time working in the coming weeks to ensure that you're able to finish.\"  Emphasize that he's working on the project to grow as a researcher as well as help out, so he may need encouragement to put in more effort than he deems appropriate.  Finally, there could be nothing you can do at all. Perhaps he has things going on in his personal life that distract him from work. Perhaps he's just not interested in the research and only wants to do the bare minimum, and is only interested in working as many hours as he needs to do his work. If there is a way to fix that, it seems a direct, frank talk would be the only way to do so.  "

Your question does not provide that level of detail.  It is very important to consider your supervisor's viewpoint. Assuming your supervisor is a university professor, including an undergraduate researcher as a coauthor will likely make that professor look good because including undergraduates in research is part of a faculty member's responsibilities. Adding a coauthor costs the supervisor nothing, so long as the supervisor adheres to ethical guidelines. I recommend asking your supervisor what you need to do to meet the requirements for coauthorship.  Confining your work to a fixed research term is not a realistic way to publish papers, though it may work sometimes. It is unclear why you \"have to leave.\"  "

      "question_body": "  S.E advisers,  I am a rising college junior (five-years tract) in US with a major in mathematics and an aspiring mathematician in the fields of theoretical computing and cryptography. I apologize for this sudden interruption but I wrote this post to seek your advice on preparing for the mathematics graduate programs; I am currently attracted to the applied mathematics. Through introduction to the computational biology, I found my true passion and love toward the mathematics, which led me to switch my major from the microbiology to mathematics on the last (Spring) semester. Since then, I have been taking basic calculus courses and also self-studied the preparatory materials (such as proof-writing) for the abstract mathematics. I am currently self-studying the abstract algebra (Artin, Dummit/Foote), abstract linear algebra (Hoffman/Kunze), and vector calculus (Lang). I will be taking the following courses on the Fall: Vector Calculus-computational, Linear Algebra with introduction to proofs, and either Abstract Algebra I or Mathematical Statistics I. At the start of August, I will be starting to conduct the supervised undergraduate research on the theoretical computing (abstract and math-heavy) and computer security (more on the programming than mathematics), which I am very excited.  I am curious what are the essential factors for admission into mathematics graduate programs. Do undergraduate research (such as mine) will be an important factor too? I know the biology programs strongly require the research experience but I frequently heard that the mathematics programs focus less on the undergraduate research since most undergraduate-level research in mathematics are viewed as less matured than the graduate-level research. Does Putnam score also play an important factor? I am interested in preparing for the Putnam Competition as it has many interesting problems on algebra and number theory (topics of my interest) and I have been preparing vigorously with the problem-solving-strategy books as I never participated in any mathematical competition before. About my current course schedule, should I take the Abstract Algebra I with other courses? At my university, the AAI hs the pre-requisite of linear algebra, but I was granted a special permission for enrollment since my research advisers strongly recommend me to take the abstract algebra for the theoretical computing and computer security. I am currently studying the abstract algebra and linear algebra to prepare for the courses and upcoming undergraduate research.  Thank you very much for your time, and I apologize for this long post.

It's nice if you have it, and if by any chance you publish a solo author paper in a respectable journal that's fantastic, but that kind of fantastic stuff is done by people who would assured of admissions to top programs anyway. Since every letter ever written about a math student's undergraduate research is positive, admissions committees just don't get enough information to use in tough admissions choices.  > I am a rising college junior (five-years tract) in US with a major in > mathematics and an aspiring mathematician in the fields of theoretical > computing and cryptography.

This is a bit disconcerting to a potential admitter. We might worry that you have not managed to settle down on any one thing for long enough to study it in any depth. Maybe that worry is totally groundless, but you should do what you can to allay it.  > Does Putnam score also play an important factor? I am interested in > preparing for the Putnam Competition as it has many interesting problems on > algebra and number theory (topics of my interest) and I have been preparing > vigorously with the problem-solving-strategy books as I never participated > in any mathematical competition before.  Similar answer to the last one but more extreme. If you score in the Top XX, that looks good, but it would be very rare for that to be the breakthrough good thing about your application. Moreover, whereas one must admit that undergraduate research in mathematics is becoming increasingly popular and viewed increasingly seriously over the years, the same cannot be said about the Putnam: if you never take it, no one cares. If you got a zero every single time, no one cares. (I took it in my freshman year only, honestly don't remember my score but suspect it might have been in the single digits, and I got into every program I applied to, including the top three.) I was never excited about contest math so I need to ensure that my own proclivities don't creep into my answer, but quite soberly: studying for the Putnam (or any university math contest) might be fun and it might be educational, but it is not much of an investment in your future. If you like algebra and number theory, great (OMG! me too) -- study algebra and number theory. Working Putnam problems would teach you more of that than watching _Game of Thrones_ , but it's still quite indirect.  > About my current course schedule, should I take the Abstract Algebra I with > other courses?

This type of question needs to be answered by someone who is familiar with you and with your department's program. We're not. It's exactly the sort of question you should ask your faculty advisor. If you don't have a faculty advisor yet, no problem: this is an excellent opportunity to get one.  One final comment: based on your writing, I suspect you are not a native speaker of English. Good English language and writing skills _are_ important for an American PhD program in mathematics: a low enough GRE verbal score can kill an application. (Conversely, in my program, in order to be competitive for the top drawer internal fellowships you have to have a high \"academic index\", which is some weighted numerical measure of your GRE quantitative, your GRE verbal and your GPA. So it's serious.) Shoring up shaky English skills is more of a priority than studying for the Putnam exam, if you ask me.  "

Five have rejected me, and the fact that none of the other 11 have sent me information tells me I'm probably on their waitlists.  I'm in my junior year and was hoping to apply to a PhD program next fall. I have a very high GPA, but I haven't taken a really competitive course load since I have been struggling with anxiety/depression for several years. It wasn't until my junior year began that I started the year-long abstract algebra and real analysis sequences. I'm planning to take grad math classes in my senior year, and ask some professors if I can get involved in research (haven't done any thus far).  I'm starting to worry about what I'm going to do this summer if I get rejected from all of the REU's... any advice? And, does this mean that I should look elsewhere instead of pursuing graduate school in pure math? I guess I'm feeling a bit discouraged about the prospects of a career in pure mathematics.  * * *  Mid-summer update: I actually did end up getting into an REU this summer, and I'm loving it here! At the same time, I'm really glad I asked this question, since it was important (both emotionally and logistically) to be prepared for the possibility of not getting into an REU. Interestingly, the professor who I'm working with told me that he never went to an REU as an undergrad; he didn't start doing research until his 3rd year of grad school. Somehow I had convinced myself that only students who do undergraduate research will become successful mathematicians. Now I understand that while doing undergraduate research can help students to delve deeper into specific topics, beef up their resumes, and prepare for graduate school, it's definitely not the \"be-all and end-all\" of a mathematician's career.

As for what to do with the summer, if you are interested in research, consider trying to work on a research project with one of the professors at your university. You say you want to do this next year, so it would be even better to start this summer, when you will have more time available and won't be distracted by coursework. Start asking them about it now.  I think it is definitely a good idea to have some sort of research experience before applying to grad school. Partly because it is helpful in admissions, but mostly because it will help you decide if it is actually something you want to do.

        "answer_body": "  To answer the first part of your question, it is definitely possible for high school students to perform research in computer science.  But let's look at the broader picture here first. Computer science spans a lot of sub-areas, which have very different flavors and require different sets of knowledge in order for you to be able to perform research in it. Being able to program is good, as this is needed in some of these areas, while there are some in which programming knowledge is normally not needed.  Research means to push forwards the frontier of mankind's knowledge. In CS, little effort is spent of replication experiments (i.e., when a finding by one group of researchers is tried to be replicated in their experimental setup). Rather, research is typically performed by trying out new ideas to solve problems that are considered to be interesting enough for research.  Now this is where the difficulty kicks in: in order to come up with a new approach for some problem of relevance, one needs to have a good overview of one area of research, which means to invest years in getting a good overview of the work performed in that area so far. Research students (e.g., PhD students) are expected to work on getting this overview themselves, while at the same time they also have an advisor at their disposal to guide them. Without an advisor that is already established in your sub-field of interest, there is a high probability that your research efforts are spent in vain (e.g., because what you would be trying to do would not be novel enough).  Thus, it may make sense for you to find an advisor that can guide you in your research work. There _are_ definitely sub-areas in computer science for which - with the proper guidance - high school students can make non-trivial contributions, while possibly also using programming knowledge.  So as a proposed course of action, look into which sub-areas there are in computer science, which one interest you, and read up a bit on the major results. Afterwards, you can check if you can make contact with possible advisors. As a high school student, you may want to aim a bit lower than at the professor level. E.g. a postdoc at the university closest to your home town working in your area of interest may be a good first point of contact.  Allow me to also add that learning to program in various languages is related to research only to a small extend. The scientific part of computing has a different flavor than most people outside CS would expect. It you haven't done so already, consider looking into the Wikipedia article on complexity theory, which gives you insight into a sub-area of computer science whose results are used in most other are sub-areas of CS as well.

Sounds like a reasonable list of goals to me. But, for your 2nd goal, the possibility of a publication coming out of your work is only that: a \"possibility.\" As you may be relatively new to research, it is probably a good idea for you to keep in mind that not all research projects result in publishable results (as [this question](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/732/why-dont-people- publish-failures) highlights).  > Would it be too forward of me to ask to contribute to something that will > result in publication (considering that I am an undergraduate and given that > there is only one month left)?  This is where it gets a bit trickier. You only have one month left on the project, and it may be difficult for your supervisor to find something meaningful, and publishable, to work on in that relatively short amount of time.  On top of that, there may be other factors working \"against\" you. For example, suppose that there is a gap your group is looking to fill, but you do not have the background necessary to make a meaningful contribution. What are they to do in this case? Drop everything they are doing to get you up to speed? I think you can see that this may be an unreasonable request.  For all I know, you are an extremely bright student who is more than capable of making a breakthrough on a tight deadline. But, if there are gaps in your knowledge, and it would take someone a nontrivial amount of effort to get you up to speed, then that could be problematic. There are other researchers in the group, and depending on the group dynamics, it may be difficult (or easy) for them to make accommodations for you on such short notice.  In the end, I think you should definitely have a chat with your supervisor, give them the lowdown on what you'd like to accomplish in your last month. Then, listen.  "

The [Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act](http://www2.ed.gov/policy/gen/guid/fpco/ferpa/index.html) stipulates the applicants have the right to inspect the letters of recommendation written on their behalf, unless said right was explicitly waived by the student. During the application process you will almost always encounter a question \"Do you waive your right to review the letters of reference?\" while entering the list of your referees. **If you feel you have a real cause for concern, you can leave that box un-ticked**. If someone actually wrote you a negative letter for the reason you described, it would be highly unethical; if you have the evidence (not just the letter written, but also proof of intent behind the letter) you can get him or her in big trouble.  * * *  Typically when a writer is asked to submit reference letters for applicants to graduate programs which fall under such a disclosure/waiver rule, the writer is informed at the time of submission whether the applicant has or has not waived the the right to view the letter. Hence not waiving your rights can have the desired effect as a deterrent.  On the other hand, some people view not waiving your right as indicating your own lack of trust in the letter writer (which in your case will be true) and will hence believe that the letter writers may not have been as candid in their evaluation as they otherwise would have.

        "answer_user_aboutme": "  Hi! Welcome to my profile. My work can be divided into two projects: _The Sphere_ and _A theory of perspective_  ## Project 1: The Sphere  The mission of _The Sphere_ is to promote self-refection, the respect to others, the curiosity to what causes fear, and the courage to cut harmful things. The targets are people who are suffering (or creating suffering to others), yet resist others' supports to maintain status quo. This includes abusers and people who developed a worldview to justify their learned helplessness. The method is to equip their friends and loved ones the skills and knowledge to help them change their mind. For starter, read about [social work case management](https://www2.slideshare.net/esahakyan/integrated-social- services-reaching-the-most-vulnerable-training-package-for-case- managers-16096590) and [consequentialism](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism).  Protectors of autonomy usually have a misconception that one's choice should always be respected, because their autonomy should always be respected. The fact is that it is only true in 99.999999% of cases, and the other 0.0000001% is people who internalized oppression. Therefore, only hoping for the best but leaving their situation intact is generally considered as undermining their autonomy. For starter, read about [relational autonomy](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-autonomy) and [decision- making capacity](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-capacity).  This project is written in Vietnamese. [Its website](https://xn--qucu- hr5aza.com/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%2Academia%20Profile&utm_medium=Homepage&utm_campaign=Homepage) attracted ~30k people in past year (~160 on average per day). Many of them are human right activists, psychologists, religion practitioners, academic researchers, artists, etc.  ## Project 2: A theory of perspective  Imagine a floating iceberg. The part above the water is the _The Sphere_ project. The part below the water is this project. It is to construct a theory for the concept \"perspective\", as in \"keep a fresh perspective\", \"look at the problem in a new perspective\", \"put yourself in other's perspective\", etc. The concept is intuitive, but exactly what it is is still vague. Because of that, these advices are easier said than done. The take-home message is this \"formula\":  > ### Challenging assumption = meaning shifting = perspective changing  For more detail you can read the [research proposal](https://lyminhnhat.com/research- proposal/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%2Academia%20Profile&utm_medium=Research%20proposal&utm_campaign=Perspectives).

As StrongBad says, \"if he/she wants to screw you over you are basically screwed and there is not much you can do\". I think if you really want to actively do something, so that you can have the feeling of controlling the situation, you will need a plan...  People tend to react with an event with the emotion they are carrying. For example, if a person just have a meeting and you can't ask them directly because it's confidential, you can offer them a cup of coffee right after they has a meet. If they answers **in a positive way** , you can conclude that the meeting has positive results. If they answers **in a negative way** , the results might be negative.  **>** Make a good plan before applying this in your situation. I propose this: try to know the time he is free, and the drink he likes. After he finishes writing your LOR, meet him **in person** , invite him to have a drink in his free time. Or you can bring the drink to him directly as thank. Don't focus on the word he answers, focus on **how comfortable** he is when answering you.  There are higher techniques to figure out what others are hiding. If you want to know more, I recommend you the book [You Can Read Anyone](https://books.google.com.vn/books/about/You_Can_Read_Anyone.html?id=7jcAh5KZBlAC&source=kp_cover&hl=en), but you can also google them easily. Note that when you trying to figure out what his altitude is, your plan is also what you hide to him. If he has some experience in psychology, be careful but at the same time be natural.  * * *  But, don't get me wrong. I really try to avoid using these techniques as best as I can. If he doesn't know the plan, good for you, but if he finds something unnatural in your action, the least bad thing is now he sees you as a problem, to the worst thing that you have a cold war to your advisor. Learning martial arts isn't for using, but for avoiding to be hurt.  While there's life, there's hope. Try to reconcile to your advisor if you can. Try to ask, with honestly (and with some techniques if you need), why he needs you to stay with him. Propose other candidate that can meet his expectation. This will be the best for both world.

My goal is to eventually work with quantum computing (computer science+physics) at the postdoctoral level. My question concerns whether undergraduate or graduate school is more influential for a given field of study.  The first university, Stanford, offers the possibility of getting a dual degree in both CS and physics, but has no serious quantum computing research. The second, Harvard, has a cutting-edge quantum computing research lab and is right next to MIT where there are other opportunities for research/classes. Harvard only offers joint degrees in two fields, not dual degrees.  I was considering attending Stanford for undergrad to get a solid foundation in both CS and physics, then applying to Harvard for grad school to do research.  **Here\u2019s my question:**  How important is doing research in your specific field of interest as an undergraduate? Is it better to just take the opportunity to go to Harvard\u2019s lab for undergrad, then look elsewhere for graduate school? Or, is it more advisable to get separate degrees in CS and physics and then apply for graduate research in Harvard's lab?  My main concern is that the lack of quantum computing research at Stanford will be a major hindrance. Will doing other unrelated research in CS or physics as an undergrad suffice just as well in the long run?  ",

In my experience, nobody cares at all whether an applicant's research experience is directly related to their proposed specialty in graduate school. There are several points to keep in mind:    1. There are only a limited number of research opportunities available for undergraduates, so finding one on your very favorite topic may not be possible. Nobody would hold this against you.    2. Some topics just aren't accessible to undergraduates in the first place (e.g., motivic cohomology).    3. Most applicants don't really know what they will write their dissertations on, even if they think they do. Many will change their minds a year or two into grad school.    4. Undergraduate research in mathematics is generally not as deep as grad student research, and the specific things you learn are not crucial. Instead, the point is to see whether you have an aptitude for research and whether you enjoy it. For those purposes, the precise topic doesn't really matter. (Unless, of course, there's only one thing in the world that you would like to study, but I would consider that sort of narrowness to be a problem itself.)  "

Newsflash: Slavery has been abolished. If you were \"exploited\", it's because you didn't do your due diligence to find out what you were getting into.

It could, and this depends on many factors (including the character of this professor, his relationship with your supervisor, your character and how you explain things etc...), I don't think anyone can predict whether or not it actually will.  I recommend first considering what you hope to achieve in discussing this with the head of the department (aka president/professor). I can imagine a couple of possibilities:    1. You feel the need to unload and feel some sympathy.   2. You care about the system and hope this can be avoided for future students.  If it is mainly the first, I strongly suggest talking to a friend over a beer instead. You'll avoid the risk, and also won't essentially waste your professor's time (which would probably negatively affect his impression of you).  If your motivation is the second, I think this is quite a noble and selfless thing to do, showing high integrity, but it does put yourself at quite a bit of risk with essentially no gain (it helps future students, but if I understand correctly, not you). If this is your goal, I urge you to first consider whether you think this professor would actually care about the advice of an undergrad (I have known professors who would appreciate it, but also some who would simply consider the student to be complaining, in which case relations with that professor would indeed worsen). If you think he will, then I suggest the following:   Before speaking to your professor, make sure you can present the situation clearly, as objectively as possible and concisely (the longer you speak, the more it sounds like a rant and you lose interest - also professors tend to be very busy, and thus have low attention spans for issues that don't seem important). Be very clear straight off the bat that you understand and agree that what has already happened has happened and nothing can/will be done for you, and your intent is solely to raise awareness of the issue so that it can be avoided in the future. Possibly put this intent in writing when contacting the professor for the meeting (again, as short as possible).  In the end, taking action here will involve risk, regardless of your intentions. You will have to weigh how much you care about the issue, and what chances you think you have.  "

Many 5-year Masters Theses are thus no better than 4-year Bachelor's theses, but will indeed be held to a higher standard (e.g., as though one had gone through a separate 2-years Masters program).  Last-minute and \"merely sufficient\" research work of this sort will also be much less effective at building trust and relationships with a faculty member than a longer time working on research as an undergraduate, even at a \"lower\" level.

Other times, the program is integrated over the full five years, making it more like a five-year undergraduate program (with the addition study that an extra year obviously entails).  In either case, there is only about one extra year for the master's-level work. That's not a lot of time for graduate-level classes and a substantial research thesis. Sometimes these programs do not require a thesis at all; in engineering departments, these are often labeled as master of engineering (rather than master of science) degrees. Even when a thesis is part of the requirements, it may not entail much (if any) original research. The thesis may be more of a extended report on the current state of a field, without any new contributions from the writer. (Of course, new results would certainly be welcomed as part of a thesis in such a program, but it is not a requirement.)  So if a student is planning to move on to a doctoral program, it may be advantageous to spend more time on research, rather than creating a thesis on the type I have described. I'm not convinced that one or the other plan is actually better. Either a one-year masters or significant undergraduate research experience would enhance a Ph.D. applicant's file.

I'll assume the requirements are the same....  Have you done any research at all, even for a big class project or something on your own? If so, mention these. The admissions committee that reviews your application will want to know that you're interested in doing research and that _you know_ what you're getting yourself in to.  If you have a couple years left before you graduate, I would try hard to get a research experience before you apply, even if you have to volunteer (work for free) for a semester. If I **had** to make a guess, I'd guess that most programs would want to see that you have done at least one or two research experiences, if only so that they know that you know what research is.  **Formal research experiences (summer research internships, for example) and publishing a paper or two are great, but they're not the only criteria.**  First, it depends on how competitive the program you are applying to is. More research experience may be needed to help you stand out enough to be accepted. Publications are always great, but research experience (which may not have resulted in a publication) is still well-regarded.  Another factor grad programs consider is how focused you are, and if you have an existing connection with a research group in that program. For example, you may have previously collaborated with a professor in their program, and he/she is familiar with your work. If you show a genuine interest in working with him/her, it will reflect well on you, and who knows -- he/she may be able to help your application get accepted. If you just want to get accepted into their program, but it looks like you have no direction or research interests after that, the committee reviewing your application will look less favorably on you.  Lastly, when you apply, you should apply for a spread of schools. Apply to 1-2 competitive programs which, if they accepted you, would make you feel lucky because you weren't sure you qualified. You should apply to several programs that you think might accept you. Lastly, apply to a few programs which you are _certain_ you would be accepted to, just in case you aren't accepted to any of the others.  "

You're going to need a bit more chutzpah in order to get your money's worth out of college and graduate studies! Perhaps you could transition into feeling more comfortable with professors' office hour visits by focusing primarily on visiting the office hours held by grad student teaching assistants for the time being.  It is very common for second year students to be hit hard with an appreciation of how little they know. Try to ride this storm of self-doubt while reminding yourself of that fact.  It would be great if you could find one or more mentors, either on your own or through a matching-up program. The mentor might be a faculty member who serves as your undergraduate advisor -- the person who checks your proposed schedule and advises you about what courses to take next year, etc.  * * *  Edit 5/20  There are several ways to break the ice.  Ask for some undergraduate advising -- s/he will check your unofficial transcript against your proposed schedule for next semester. Make sure you have this conversation in this person's office, not over email, because what we want to happen is for the professor's natural mentoring instincts to kick in, so that one thing leads to another.  In the experimental sciences, one can ask for a tour of his/her lab. You might want to ask your question over at Mathematics Education as well.  Spend some time reading the research descriptions of the faculty in your department, to see whose area intrigues you, then take a look at some of their papers. When you find one that gets you intellectually excited, make an appointment like this: Dear Professor So-and-so, I've been reading your \"title of paper\", and wonder if I could make an appointment to come in and talk with you about this area of research?\" Or something like that. Researchers love to talk with people about their work.  To get matched up through a formal matching up program, you need to look closely at your department's website, or ask your department administration if there is such a thing.  * * *  During the school year, attend lots of seminars. Be bold about chatting with grad students over cookies afterwards. If no one is bringing cookies, juice and paper cups, bring some!  "

I would suggest picking a class/subject in your major that you will preferably be taking next semester. Then don't wait - start now! If you don't know what the course is really about (I know I rarely do in advance!), you can try to meet with a professor who will teach the class, with a department chair, or with your adviser, or you can write a short email. Let them know you want to get a jump on the next semester to prepare yourself for advanced studies/research in the future. If a general class schedule or syllabus is available, even better!  Then set yourself a nice schedule for the summer - giving yourself plenty of time to actually relax and recharge your batteries for the coming semester - and get cracking! Next semester you should be generally better prepared and be able to learn the subject deeper and more readily than others, rather than scrambling to learn what you need to keep up. You should hopefully be able to ask more insightful and interesting questions, participate in class, and maybe also go to office hours and ask even more advanced questions about the material to move towards mastery. With the extra prep you'll likely be able to also do better grade-wise.  All this extra contact and work will not only improve your education, but if you have been shy this can be your first deeper connection with a professor. After you've had time to work with them and become more comfortable, and if things are going well and they are recognizing you are a good and dedicated student who wants more than just a degree and to move on, then you will be in a great position to ask them about research options in the future - or for recommendations/introduction to another professor who you might want to work with.  You can also apply this same \"show up, participate, ask questions, go to some office hours/meetings\" strategy to other classes, and begin to make more contacts - naturally! It's much less stressful than it seems at first, and you might develop some valuable skills and meet some really cool people. You can then repeat all this strategy the following semester as well, and begin planning for doing research/independent study during a semester or over summer if that suits you.  Finding people you work well with and have more advanced connection to you beyond just class will also conveniently be able to help you with getting research, work with you when you hit more advanced topics, and as a bonus can also be the source of future reference letters which are actually useful because they know you outside of class!  Rather than panicking, I'd suggest you take a deep breath and instead work to prepare yourself so in the following semesters and next summer you will be ahead of the game rather than behind. And if you continue to follow through and put in the effort and use good strategy, you'll find yourself likely enjoying the process more, having better connections, being more prepared, and generally making the most of your education - and maybe even being in a better position for an advanced degree, too.

        "answer_body": "  > Would it be acceptable to set up a foldable cot at night (leave it under my > desk during the day) and sleep at the lab occasionally?  A worldwide internet academic community like this one cannot answer your question directly. You need to ask the head of the lab. This is the person who will need to vouch for you if any other university member (student, employee, faculty...) finds you there at night, and this is the person who needs to feel confident that someone sleeping in the lab is neither a threat, a conflict of interest nor an embarrassment to the lab and its work.  I will go way outside my direct experience and speculate that keeping and using a cot **directly inside a university laboratory** is not something that the head of the lab is likely to approve. I don't know exactly what is being done in the lab, but if it's in EECS, sleeping is presumably not an intended use of the space. If you are sleeping right next to expensive and/or delicate equipment, then you are not using it as you have been trained to do, and in some (perhaps annoying but nevertheless real) legal sense you may not be qualified to remain in the presence of such equipment in a less than alert state. What if you stumble out of your cot and onto something?  On the other hand, a student lounge is an entirely different story: that seems precisely like a designated space for students to spend down time. If you put a couch in your lounge, then you can reasonably expect people to at least take naps. It would seem like a much better idea to me to place a cot in the lounge rather than the lab itself. If you don't want to do this because there could also be other people there: well, again, the lab itself is not your personal sleeping space. I would think that you could ask even a senior grad student or postdoc \"Hey, is it okay if I keep a cot in the lounge and sleep on it occasionally if I need to?\"  Finally, although if the right people say so you certainly can sleep in/adjacent to the lab, I wanted to recommend that you give some thought to the work-life issues involved. In the long run, most people are much happier sleeping in a bed in a place of their own and also having some downtime / nonwork interactions between sleep and attending class. If you are sleeping nights in the lab with just a stored cot are you not showering / doing morning and evening hygiene / putting on clean clothes before you wake up in the lab and then go to class? This is most certainly possible and there are institutions full of large numbers of students who do it (I frequented an all- night cafe at MIT as a graduate student and encountered many students there whose motto seemed to be \"No shower until I finish this week's problem set\". It wasn't pretty.) But nevertheless most people realize that this is just less healthy, less fun and even less productive than doing things in a more balanced way. For that matter, what is it that you're doing in a lab for hours past the time that everyone else goes home? Is all that time really needed? I mean, intensity is great, but after a certain point it gets a little manic. Many of the most successful academics that I know work incredibly hard in a certain sense; but I don't know any leading academic that literally spends all their waking hours working. You just can't do good work for that much time. Anyway, it's worth thinking about.  "

Also, when there are existing pedagogic review articles, or otherwise detailed accounts which could pass off as pedagogic, authors generally tend to avoid a detailed presentation, simply cite them and get to their main point.  Since you say that  > My mentor wants me to thoroughly understand the ideas stated here because we > are going to be implementing those soon albeit with modifications.  it is clear that he/she wants you to understand the basics thoroughly, and not just be limited to the arguments presented in the one article you have at hand. So, if this article appears cryptic, you have no choice but to go through the cited ones for clarifications. Try to see if they are less cryptic, it is possible that the authors may have cited a review article of the sorts I mentioned above. That will certainly help. Based on that understanding, when you revisit your particular article at hand, you will understand it much better and better understand what it adds to the subject.  However, if that doesn't work out, and you still find the arguments too cryptic, consult your advisor and explain why you find it cryptic, which arguments are not transparent etc. It helps to carry along with you the attempts you made towards understanding it yourself, so that he/she knows you are not asking to be spoon-fed. Once he's convinced that you made an effort from your side, he will generally point you towards other articles which could clear up the specific point for you.  I mean, there is no other choice. There is no way you can gain anything out of this collaboration, or implementing anything, unless you are clear about what you are doing.  "

My algorithmic biology research got me passionate about the number theory and analysis, and I have been pursuing a mathematics major starting on this Spring semester. I have been independently self-studying the number theory textbooks written by Niven/Zuckerman/Montgomery, Apostol, and Ireland/Rosen on this semester. As this semester progressed, I discovered that I am more interested in the pure mathematics than applied aspects (computational biology, cryptography, etc.). I want to pursue a career as analytic number theorist and prove the Collatz conjecture and Erdos-Straus conjecture.  I have been thinking about doing the number-theory research on my university (research university; huge mathematics department). I have been self-studying the NT by myself and also regularly attending the professional and graduate seminars on number theory but I did not do any pure mathematics research as an undergraduate. Should I visit NT professors in my university and ask them about if I can do undergraduate research under them? If research is not possible (perhaps due to my lacking maturity), should I request of doing independent reading under them and later proceed with the research? How should I ask them? What should I address? If even independent reading is not desirable to them, what should I ask to them or do in my own?  As for my mathematical background, I have been taking Calculus II (computational) and discrete mathematics. I will be taking calculus III (vector calc.) on Summer, followed by Analysis I, Probability, Theoretical Linear Algebra on Fall 2015. As for my self-studying on this semester, I have been studying NT textbooks (mentioned above), proof methodologies, and basic linear algebra.  Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to your advice!  Sincerely,  PK  ",

You can start the conversation by telling them what books you've been working with, and ask for some academic advising. This means the professor will go over your plan (which courses to take, when, and in what order) with you. The professor will likely confirm the wisdom of the tentative plan you came up with -- and then the conversation will blossom from there.

You mention that you are at a large research university, presumably with a large graduate program - in these places I expect that it is pretty rare for an undergraduate to do research directly with a faculty member unless they are exceptionally talented. Faculty members have their own research programs and their own graduate students to direct, and coming up with interesting yet tractable problems is hard! However, it can't hurt to ask. Since you've been regularly attending seminars, you should know who the regular attendees are - send an email to someone to set up a meeting to chat (or drop by an open office hour), tell them what you've told us, and ask if they have any suggestions for what you should do next. Sending the email first gives them the chance to think about your meeting ahead of time, and if they're not interested they could just send an email back saying so. As for what exactly to ask, I would recommend just asking for suggestions and see what they come up with. If they don't seem inclined to do so, asking for suggestions on what to read/which courses to take is a good plan.  In a smaller liberal arts place, perhaps surprisingly, there are more opportunities for undergraduate research, and just generally more opportunities for interacting with faculty members.  However, there are other opportunities to get into research other than working directly with faculty. In a large research university, there are probably lots of graduate students and postdocs (who probably also attend the same seminars as you). They, particularly if they are interested in a more teaching-focused direction, might be willing to talk to you on some regular basis about your readings. (I recently heard of the [University of Chicago Directed Reading program](http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~may/VIGRE/), which sounds pretty cool.)  Lastly, I know that you mentioned you wanted to do research at your own institution, but I'd like to ask you to reconsider. There are several summer research opportunities in mathematics, and they are a fantastic opportunity not only to learn math and get the experience of tackling a problem on your own (or in a small group), it's also good to just meet other people at your stage in life with similar interests, as well as mathematicians from other universities.

        "answer_body": "  There is, unfortunately, no single answer to this question. In most fields undergraduate publication is uncommon enough that any publications look good. However, the amount of value added by publications compared to GPA will depend on a range of factors, including the following:  **Area of study:** Some disciplines may place a higher importance on social or community projects rather than publications, while others may prize GPA. You will need to determine how your discipline prioritizes these academic goals. Within my discipline (psychology) undergraduate publications can be helpful if applying to graduate school, but are not expected of incoming graduate students.  **Intended career:** Similarly, if you are entering an applied field once you graduate, they may be far more interested in other, more concrete forms of experience. Again, for someone pursuing a clinical career in psychology, publications (especially those that are clinically relevant) might be nice, but employers are more likely to be interested in clinical experience. If you are entering industry they may pay little attention to your GPA, assuming it hits a basic threshold. If you are intending to pursue an advanced degree publications may be more useful, but again this will depend on your discipline.  **Amount your GPA will drop:** If you have an excellent GPA and will be risking only a small drop (so that you would still consider your final GPA to be competitive), then it may be worth pursuing publication. Many graduate programs in the USA look for a basic cut off in GPA when considering admissions; that is, so long as it is \"good enough\" it is ok. However, what is considered \"good enough\" will vary by discipline and program. If you are risking a substantial drop in GPA, it may not be worth it. Be sure you have a sense of how low your grades could be while still maintaining what you consider to be an acceptable GPA. Then determine if you feel the burden of publishing will put you at risk of missing that mark.  **Quality/timing/authorship of publications:** The overall impact of your publications will influence how much \"extra value\" they add to your career or academic pursuits. Obviously, higher impact journals will look better than lower-tier. Beyond just having the publication on your CV, the quality of the work and your role in the work will also matter. Being involved with the development or conceptualization of the project will be more valuable in terms of experience than if you assist with data entry. That type of conceptual involvement will better enable you to discuss the project and its implications in job or graduate school interviews. Additionally, in some fields the order of authorship on papers is important and holding a valued authorship position (first, second, last, etc. depending on field) may be beneficial. In disciplines that do not assign weights to the order of authorship (e.g., mathematics), this is a non-issue.  **Impact on your personal life:** Finally, you will have to determine whether pursuing publications is worth the significant amount of time you believe it will take. Think about this carefully. If you begin to make some trade-offs with your GPA to pursue publishing, and then decide the work load is too much of a burden in other aspects of your life, it may be difficult to refocus on your grades.  If you are having difficulty evaluating these different factors, **seek advice from a mentor, professor, or someone who is pursuing the career you are interested in.** You may also be able to gather some information about how your field and possible career paths value these factors by looking at graduate program entrance requirements, job postings, and the publicly available resumes or CVs of people in your field.

Is this a problem? The way I see it, there are several arguments for and against:  **For:**    * The background material is \"standard\" in the sense that anyone who works on this class of problems would know the definitions or results in some form. However, this is at most a few hundred people, while if I include the background material my paper should be comprehensible to an advanced undergraduate.    * Some of the background results are part of the folklore of the field, and I've never been able to find a proof of them in literature. While they are believable and not hard to prove, I feel someone should bother doing it. More selfishly, this is one more reason for people to cite my paper.    * I don't know of any one reference which states _all_ the background material I need, so if I don't include it my readers have to chase down multiple sources and I have to use conflicting notations.  **Against:**    * It may be annoying to an expert in the field, although they could skip much of it and mainly refer to the background section for notation.    * It makes the paper longer, although even with the background the paper is not long (13 pages).    * From what I've heard, it is generally considered bad practice to restate definitions and constructions states elsewhere and to reprove theorems available in literature. In part this is because it gives the impression that I haven't read the literature.

Yes, the necessary background is likely scattered among several prior papers, and some occurs \"nowhere\", in the sense of being apocryphal... lost in the mists of time? :) Nevertheless, the highest-status refereed journals would probably want more-discursive broader explanations edited out... and the referees and editors might interpret your inclusion of such things as \"amateurish\" (\"It's just not done...\"), to your detriment.  But the expectations or standards of refereed-journals is certainly not the only criterion, and is manifestly antithetical to the obviously desirable outcome of wider dissemination of ideas, collection and organization of otherwise-chaotic literature, and so on. Some people will tell you that somehow it's not ok to \"mix\" \"research\" and \"exposition\"... but this is silly, even if traditional. But, then, given the traditional predilection of refereed-journals, if you want a more discursive version of your write-up, you may have to reconcile yourself to having two versions, one for referees, one for exposition/wider-dissemination.  The for-referees version should probably _not_ cite the discursive version, but, instead, do the quasi-unhelpful bit of citing the disparate standard sources. The discursive version could cite the for-referees version, as well as the standard sources, and still include your own updated presentation, bringing apocrypha to the light of day, and so on.

In principle you could certainly put in too much, but in practice I don't think I've ever seen a mathematics paper I thought actually did have too much. If you structure your writing so experts can easily skim things they already know, then I don't see why extra explanation should trouble anyone. Tradition requires being concise, but that tradition was based on the economics of publishing. Space in printed journals used to be a scarce resource, and if you spent it on unnecessary exposition you were keeping someone else from publishing at all. Publishing still isn't free (and readers have only so much patience, as well), so you shouldn't include enormous amounts of unnecessary background, but traditional writing styles should be adjusted to account for the greater availability of space.  It's possible that a referee or editor will object that they don't like your style. You may be able to resist making any changes (it depends on how exciting your paper is and how high your own status is within the community), and if you do make changes you can still keep a lot of explanation.  If necessary, it's worth having two versions as Paul Garrett suggests. If you do, then you should make it very clear which is which and what the differences are, to avoid serious confusion if someone refers to the paper without realizing they need to specify which version.  > The background material is \"standard\" in the sense that anyone who works on > this class of problems would know the definitions or results in some form. > However, this is at most a few hundred people, while if I include the > background material my paper should be comprehensible to an advanced > undergraduate.

This does seem like a worry, and five references is not very many, even for a 13-page paper. You might not strictly need any more, but I'd recommend tracking down additional references for background. As a general rule it's best to cite generously, giving plenty of credit to other authors and offering many resources to readers.  Regarding giving the impression that you haven't read the literature, it's important to be clear about what's background from the literature (with a citation), what's folklore, and what's your own contribution. If you reprove something you say is known but don't give a citation for, it can look like you were too lazy to track it down.  "

You can include something that is part of the literature; to show you know the literature, you just need to also add a citation \u2014 doing otherwise can be bad practice (if it's very clear the result is not yours), and might be taken for unethical by somebody who misunderstand what you claim.  But you should decide whether to re-include the proofs though \u2014 can you lift the statement directly, adapting the notation? Or is the setting different enough that you need to adapt the proof? Or is it important that a reader knows the proof to get your paper, because you reuse similar proof ideas?  However, things in mathematics might be different; advice still should have similar consequences, but conventions are different. Let me say that the habits of mathematicians are quite frustrating to e.g. computer scientists.

In all the cases you can, and should, continue with your current work. Remember that what your professors or teachers look after your BA thesis is that you manage to amalgamate what you have learned on your undergraduate period, but not necessarily to present some novel contribution as it happens on the PhD studies.

In my experience, it's best to be actively interacting with a professor. But in most cases it's unlikely you'll be actively assisting with their research programs (they have usually have graduate students/postdocs for that).  You could be given either a small project related to their funded work or possibly some crazy idea they're unwilling to let a grad student spend time on. Or anything in between.  > What do graduate admissions committees really consider \"research\", though?  If you can do any work that results in something published in a journal or conference, or even a poster, will be very valuable for graduate school admissions. It doesn't matter if that work is lab or computer-based.

        "answer_body": "  I think your question is perhaps ambiguous (does \"typical length of time\" mean hours you put in, or days/months from the start of the project?), and not really answerable regardless of the interpretation. There are different kinds of undergraduate research. Here are a couple of the usual ways undergrad research is done:    1. A somewhat intensive short period of time (6-8 weeks, say) where a student works on a topic chosen by an advisor ahead of time. Presumably these topics are carefully chosen so that the student is able to make real progress in such a short period of time. These projects are often in the form of an REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates). If you do some googling, you will likely find REU's in your field of study, and some advisors/organizers nicely list all of the publications that come out of the REU's. You will see that not all REU projects result in publications.    2. Working over a longer period of time with a specific professor in your department. This can be an actual job, where you are paid to work in a research lab, or it can be an \"independent study\" course, where you actually get a couple of credits to work with a professor on a research project. If you are being paid to do research as a student job, your hours may be (at least technically) limited by university policy. This type of research _can_ be very substantial. For example, I knew a person who worked in a professor's fluid mechanics lab for all 4 years of his undergraduate education, and I think they produced and published some nice results.  So, for shorter more packaged projects, I think a \"typical\" time would be 6-8 weeks. For longer, more open-ended projects, you could potentially work with a professor for years (depending on lab space, grant money, etc.). All of this is highly field-dependent I'm sure.  Now, all of this being said, I think the most important point to make is that _publications should not be your ultimate goal_. Work hard, be passionate about your field of study, learn as much as you can, and keep up on the other things you have to do as an undergrad. If you do this, then you will impress your advisors and have great letters of recommendation, which will help you get into a great graduate school, and then you can spend the rest of your career worrying about publications :)  "

I go to a famous university in the UK and even though I've spent two of my summers doing research projects that were 8 weeks long, I've only been listed as an author in one conference abstract & talk so far. For example my first project would have been publishable if it had worked but the problem was far too complex and it didn't work out.  I'm now in my masters year and much more likely to get a publication from the work I've been doing in the past few months (2-3). There are up to 3 papers my supervisor is talking about my work being included in and . I put this better outcome down to better vision from the supervisor, harder work and better work from myself due to experience and the fact the group are looking to publish soon.  It's very complex balance of things, if your main goal of a project is to publish which is fair enough because this is how we concretely measure progress in academia, I'd suggest a minimum of 8 weeks work would be required. You also want to keep an eye out on how frequently groups are publishing and ask the research scientists you look to work with about publishing prospects when deciding. If you were writing the paper yourself then you need extra time for that too.  "

The point is, it would probably give you good odds of getting the position if you show that you are already in touch with the topic, have some working knowledge and interest in really learning about it well (for me that's optimization, abstraction and low level programming that show that I'm really into it), and that you're already capable of delivering some work, and thus can give them better quality work in less time than other candidates.   Also, having a large portfolio/showcase with plenty of good work in it, shows that other than knowing what you're doing, you like doing it and are working a lot, thus you _will_ deliver work rather than just occupy space and, possibly, resources.       In short: do what you can to show that a) you're already into it (less training, producing sooner), b) you're good at it (no low quality work), c) you _will_ deliver work (not just trying to pass your time / put a check on the task). This is my approach to the whole issue.  "

But an important consideration is making sure it contributes to a strong application package.  If you chose to take the additional classes, their grades would be reflected on your transcript and in your GPA, and so there would be an objective measure of how you had mastered their content and in so doing had become a better candidate for admission.  If you do the independent project, you want to consider carefully how its results will be communicated so as to strengthen your application package. You might at some point discuss this with the project supervisor. If publishable output is a possibility, that's great, but I'm assuming that's unlikely. But if things go well (AFTER it's established that things are going well), you should approach your supervisor about providing a reference letter that you can include with your applications. You don't want to just have that project listed in your application alongside all your other classes; you want to be able to demonstrate how doing independent research as an undergrad made you more likely to succeed as a graduate student (thereby making it easier for the admissions committees to justify offering you a place in their incoming class).

This is the situation where you can no longer increase your _rate of advancement_. In effect your effort is \"bounded from above\". I am thinking primarily about research and learning from a student's perspective but I am sure this problem is common to everyone eventually. There must be some limit at which even the greatest stop accelerating. Given that this barrier has existed for a long time and affects every human that ever lived, there must be structual approaches to overcoming exhaustion of the lowhanging fruit. What are proven methods to continue improvement, or, failing that, hug the limit of natural ability as tightly as possible? Similarly to compound interest, if you underperform by 3% every year, then in 24 years you will be half the man you could have been.  The answer from Ben succiently explains this idea in the work equation:  work = (work rate)*(hours worked)  Assume that for whatever reason the goal is to maximize the work. If one can no longer increase the hours worked, what are strategies to increase the work rate? What are new ways of thinking that can keep one at maximum possible performance? Are there ways of structuring your time that you have found that just _work_.

        "answer_body": "  Have you talked with your advisor or another mentor about your concerns? Getting another person's advice and insights can be crucial, particularly from someone who knows you well but has a broader perspective. Think of it in athletic terms: even the most talented athletes can't reach their full potential without skilled coaching. Generic advice and strategies can help, but they can't replace continuous guidance that is tailored to your specific needs.  It sounds like you've done a great job of working hard, but that's only part of the picture, and you may even have gone beyond diminishing returns to reach the point of burning yourself out.  So if it's not just a matter of hard work, what else can you do? This is a difficult question, since of course nobody on this site knows enough about your talents and accomplishments to say anything specific, but here are a few possibilities:    1. How well calibrated is your ambition? Some people devote a lot of time to research topics that are beneath their talents and will never lead anywhere exciting; they need to take on greater challenges. Others are so determined to accomplish something amazing that they waste time struggling fruitlessly with the deepest challenges while ignoring other exciting and more approachable topics.    2. Are you juggling an appropriate number of projects? Focusing exclusively on one project can be less productive, since you can't switch modes when you feel stuck or frustrated. On the other hand, switching too frequently is a good way to get nothing done.    3. How much time are you spending on activities in your field outside of your current, direct research interests? For example, attending talks, chatting with other researchers, reading famous papers, filling in gaps in your background knowledge, etc. If you neglect these things, you won't grow as much as a researcher, but if you spend too much time on them, they will distract you from actually doing research.  Notice that each of these topics is a balancing act, in which going too far in either direction is problematic. That's what makes them difficult, and it's why feedback from a mentor can be so valuable.  "

        "answer_body": "  I am sorry to say but your way of thinking in the long run will be counter- productive for you. You must always set small, visible, measurable goals instead of vague infeasible plans that may be out of your reach. E.g., It is one thing to say \"I enjoy playing the guitar so I will practice to be the best guitar player I can be\" and another to say \"I am going to be the greatest guitar player that ever stepped on this earth\" or \"I am going to be the greatest rock star ever\".  In this sense, your thought \" _I still have the dream of significant contributions to my field_ \" is toxic and it will probably lead you to frustration (unless you are [Terence Tao](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terence_Tao)) or burn out, because the success of this dream is determined by outside factors that you cannot control or influence. Also this goal is egoistical. I am positive, that most people who made significant impact on their field did not started for such a self - centered goal but instead it was their desire to do research and their skills to do so that lead them to success. World recognition or fame is mostly a motive for those who will do everything from hacking results, stealing papers and falsifying research to get ahead from the pack.  So you must strive for smaller feasible milestones that bring you closer to your remote goal but are within your reach. Such milestones might be: \"Get good grades so I can go to a better university for a PHD than my current school\", \"Write my first paper\", \"Get accepted for a PHD\", \"Get a PHD\" and so- on. Setting goals should not be a static process but must be flexible enough to adapt to external feedback. And take the hints from external feedback to adjust accordingly. E.g., It will be unreasonable to expect to make significant impact to a scientific field if you cannot write even your first paper. Therefore dreams and ambition are nice but as you already figured out we all have some external and internal limits that we cannot overcome.  Also success is not linear and it is a combination of many factors. Some of them are: Drive, hard work, ability and luck. You obviously have the drive and you want to invest the hard work but you also need luck and the necessary skills. You also need other people's help. You must seek for people who will believe in you, will see your hard work and are willing to help. Supervisors who will do their best to mentor you. A spouse who will support you on the inevitable rejections of research. You just cannot do everything alone. You need other people for that. And abandoning the social component of life entirely to compensate for what? So that you will once be a famous researcher? It really makes no sense. In other words, if research is what you want to do, then research should be fun for you (you do not do it for the money anyway). And right now, even before starting doing actual research you do not seem happy.  "

        "answer_body": "  You can improve, almost certainly. It's hard to know how much a priori, and that's true of most everything. You shouldn't be pessimistic.  First, do not mistake working long hours with making progress. As others have indicated, this often is counterproductive. [Matt Might gives the following equation for work output](http://matt.might.net/articles/work-life-balance/):  output = (work rate) * (hours worked)  Hours worked is only part of the equation. And your work rate, the amount of output you produce per hour, is also a function of hours worked. Work too much and you'll burn out (mathematically, this means your work rate will approach zero). As you've suggested, you need to work smarter, not necessarily more.  Second, you definitely have a [fixed mindset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindset#Fixed_mindset_and_growth_mindset). If you believe things are hopeless, well, even if they aren't, you probably won't improve. You need a growth mindset to improve. This is where you believe you can improve. Work on this.  Most likely, success is determined by both talent and focusing effort towards the right things. In my experience, effort is more important if you show any reasonable amount of ability. I can think of many people who I consider smarter than myself, who accomplish less. Some of these people even put a lot of effort in, but unfortunately they put the effort in the wrong way. Some of them are just \"unlucky\" (though [luck can be influenced too](http://www.richardwiseman.com/research/psychologyluck.html), it seems).  So what can you do to improve? No one is magically good at first. You need the right strategy to figure out how to get better. A strategy research has found to be common is [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_%28learning_method%29#Deliberate_practice). There are a lot of books on this subject. One I've read is [Talent is Overrated](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/B001HD8NZ8). The basics of the strategy should not surprise anyone, but you'd be surprised by how few people actually implement it. Deliberate practice is about focusing on what's actually valuable, not what just feels productive. In studies of musicians, for example, researchers looked at how accomplished people became and what their practice strategies were. The most accomplished musicians focused on the parts they had difficulty with, while the less accomplished ones spent most of their time playing music they were already comfortable with. The lesson here should be clear: you need to challenge yourself to improve. See what you need to learn to accomplish what you want. This might be learning certain theory, or learning how to do experiments, or learning to do research better, or whatnot.  Target the gaps in your knowledge, and fill them in as you go along (Anonymous Mathematician suggests this). This is an essential habit in my view. It can be hard to implement, and I am not perfect at it, but over the past year I have started writing down things which I need to learn or understand poorly and started filling in the gaps roughly in order of importance or usefulness. Some of these things are trivial (for example, learning Roman numerals) but others are research-level questions.  I find solving problems to be particularly helpful in highlighting gaps that I did not know I had. Textbooks have a lot of these, but I tend to find problems posted on internet websites (say, StackExchange sites) to be more diverse and ultimately more helpful for me.  I'm a graduate student right now, and I dedicate about 1.5 hours a day towards learning. In the past, I was inconsistent about this, and I had ineffective learning strategies (e.g., just reading a book is not likely to make a strong impression). Being consistent, using good learning strategies, and focusing on what's important has made me much more effective.  Some other books I would recommend to students interested in overcoming plateaus are [The Complete Problem Solver](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0805803092) and [Your Memory](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1569246297). The latter book in particular caused me to change a large number of my habits, and I think I am a much more effective student and teacher now. The book details a lot about how to learn and remember more effectively. I'd also recommend the software [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) to reduce the amount you forget.  "

        "answer_body": "  When you go to school, as a young child, most of what you are learning are fundamentally well characterised skills that require _practice_. In this context, the more time and effort applied, the better you get (directly).  The further through the education system you go, the more success is measured in terms of insight and understanding. The relationship between the amount of work done, and the insight and understanding gained is extremely loose - as a simple example, which is more useful, to do double the amount of work that is 10% easier, or half the amount of work that is 10% harder? I suspect often the latter.  At undergraduate level and beyond, the sheer volume of work completed becomes a relatively minor component of success, and those who try and optimise their life in this way tend to hit a fairly solid limit of achievement that they cannot breach. Ultimately, no matter how much you optimise your life, you will only gain a handful of percentage points of productivity gain - and somehow other people will achieve multiples more than you. They are not doing so by working harder, or longer, or even doing \"more work\".  There are a number of things to consider.  ## Ideas are interconnected  Learning a large and complicated area is well described as building a mosaic of understanding, piece by piece. What matters is that you strategically place the pieces and put your effort into comprehending how they relate to each other to form the larger picture. The amount of effort put into making each piece perfect is of much more minor concern.  There is a certain amount of expertise that is required to (for instance) pass exam questions in specific areas. You will find that as you gain more of an overview of a field, the specific expertise will become easier to pick up (rather than the other way around).  You will gain a lot from always examining:  i) I have leant an idea. What is the edge of applicability of this idea. Do I know where my knowledge runs out? Can I make an informed judgement about areas of learning that might be opened up by this, before we get to them?  ii) Can I apply what I have learnt in other areas than the one it was taught in? Is there anything else that I have learnt that makes more sense now?  iii) Is there anything that we haven't been taught that would be useful for me to understand here, either to extend my understanding or support it?  ## Communication is key  In an intellectual, or learning context, the ability to communicate ideas well is the measure of comprehension. Don't leave it until examinations to rely on this.  At the very least, talk to your peers about what you have learnt. Discuss, as above, the limits of what you know, and equally what you don't know. Fill in each others gaps.  If you have the opportunity, do some teaching. Even if this is of people who are much more junior than you, you will find that your understanding of your field will grow substantially. Especially if you ask your students to ask questions - magically these questions will illuminate areas that you didn't appreciate what you knew (or find gaps in your perspective).  ## People are important  Your best ideas will come from talking to other people. Especially people not doing exactly what you are doing. At the simplest level, it will encourage you to think about the same things in a different way. It may also pique your interest to look at something you hadn't thought of.  In our department, tea time is considered the most important time of day. Once in the morning, and once in the afternoon, everyone sits around over a cup of tea or coffee and talks. Sometimes about the weather, sometimes about what their kids are doing at school, sometimes about how students they are teaching are doing, and sometimes about research.  It sounds silly, but this is often where ideas come from. If someone is struggling to turn up regularly they will end up being dragged along. This social element is _critical_. In the first 6-months of my first postdoc, a conversation over tea had more of an impact on the direction and success of my research than my efforts during my PhD. Because we came up with a good idea. I wasn't expecting that when I poured my coffee.  ## Think about what you are looking at  If you are focussing on volume of work, you are almost by definition not focussing your attention on choosing _what_ you look at.  Find things that are hard. That pique your curiosity. That are a bit outside of what you have to do. Your intellectual future will depend on finding what you are really interested in - and it helps if this is not exactly the same as everyone else. And you certainly can't be told what to be interested in.  ## Don't stress about failures  There will be times you don't understand things. That you get things wrong. That you get stuck. Don't worry.  Put something you are struggling with aside. Do something else for a while. Preferably something really different. Go back to it later. Ponder things. Ask someone else.  Everyone gets stuck sometimes.  Overcoming being really stuck involves (and causes) gains of insight. This is what you are aiming for - but it is not readily achieved by just working more.  ## Exercise, eat and sleep  For your mind to work well, your body needs to as well. Get some exercise. Make sure you socialise. Finally, for your memory to work well, you need to eat well and get enough sleep.  Don't skimp on these.  On any individual day you can get more done by working longer, and harder. But it comes at terrible long term cost of decrease of average productivity, loss of insight, and worst of all, exhaustion and loss of curiosity.  ## Most of all be curious  When you find something interesting, you will learn. Do the things you find interesting (and hard). Feed your curiosity.  "

At the end of my freshman year, I began working with my advisor (\"Prof A\") on non-research-focused design projects (i.e. not the sort of thing that would lead to a publication), as a way to get some experience working under an advisor and to \"get my foot in the door\". He was highly impressed by my work (specifically the effort and time I put into the work) and gave me more opportunities at the beginning of this school year (fall 2014) to do more work with him on some research-focused projects.  As this year has progressed, Prof A has given me more and more support and has continued to help me gain funding for my own projects, and is the primary reason that I have excelled up to this point. He has certainly become someone who I would consider to be my mentor in many ways.  Despite all of the great opportunities I have received so far, I want to expand my horizons from the narrow topics I have worked on so far in research. Recently, I asked a different professor (\"Prof B\") to work on his research team, and he offered me a position. I immediately accepted, knowing that his research is something in which I'm highly interested, and something that I could certainly see myself researching in graduate school. I do not plan on letting this new project with Prof B in any way interfere with the work I am doing with Prof A; I simply plan to work on both concurrently. It should be noted that Prof B was fully aware of my work in Prof A's lab, and this played a role in his eagerness to have me on his research team.  When I mentioned my new research position to Prof A, he seemed disappointed in his demeanor (although nothing he said was necessarily disapproving), as though my working in another lab were not appropriate. I had thought that this should be no problem, especially coming from the standpoint that he is not my advisor in the way that a Ph.D. student has an advisor, so there is no obligation, per se, to consult him before taking on new work.  Was I wrong in not going to Prof A for advisement about this new opportunity, considering all he has done for me? Or was I correct that I have the right to go and find other opportunities if I wish?  As a broader question for the future, does the same etiquette apply in graduate school (master's and doctoral)? Or should actions be different in the two different situations?  ",

        "answer_body": "  I don't think the arxiv is the right place to upload unfinished work, no matter what you hope to gain from it. It would be worth reading [what the arxiv says about what should be submitted](http://arxiv.org/help/submit) as well as talking to others and seeing what is done in practice in your field. My own understanding is that the arxiv is an \"e-print server\", i.e., an electronic preprint server. A **preprint** is a completed paper which has not yet been published. (Though one can still upload published papers to the arxiv in many cases...)  It is only fair to mention that a small but non-negligible percentage of arxiv papers are not intended for submission to journals in their current forms. For instance, I currently have 27 arxiv papers; a few of them have not been submitted yet, and one of them is not intended for journal submission in its current form. I was asked to upload it to the arxiv because a colleague of mine wanted to cite it in his accepted journal article and the journal had asked for something a little more formal and stable than my own homepage. In retrospect, I think this was a good idea on their part. But all of my arxiv submissions are \"complete\".  Concerning incomplete submissions, here is a sentence from the webpage linked to above:  > Please note that we do not accept submissions with omitted figures, tables > or sections. We also do not accept \"abstract only\" submissions. Such > submissions are unhelpful to readers and of very limited archival value.  Based on what you describe, I am concerned that your putative arxiv submission would violate either the letter or the spirit of this requirement. You certainly do not want to submit to the arxiv in this case, because the arxiv is moderated, and low quality submissions can cause you to lose future privileges (as well as giving you a very poor reputation with at least the arxiv moderators, who presumably have some stature and influence in the academic community).  On the other hand, in many cases whether a paper is \"unfinished\" is known only to the author, and it would probably be possible for you to prepare a version of your paper which meets the above requirements. In my opinion, as an undergraduate you should not upload (or widely distribute in any e-forum) work that you know to be seriously incomplete. Work that you upload to the arxiv stays there forever. (Truly: even if you withdraw a paper, the record of it remains and people can still access all the earlier versions. I don't know about anyone else, but when I see a withdrawn paper it makes me curious and thus _more likely_ to look at earlier versions.) Outsiders are not going to judge your work by undergraduate standards; in many cases they will not know that the work was written by an undergraduate. They'll look at a paper that has the level of an incomplete undergraduate project: that is not making a good name for yourself.  If you want to include your unfinished manuscript in your application, that's a different story: definitely do so if you spent a lot of time on the work and are proud of it. (Even mature academics list unfinished manuscripts on their CV and sometimes even post them on their webpage. I do this, although less often as time goes on.) I may as well say the obvious thing though: **it would be better if you finished it**. Couldn't a hard-nosed faculty evaluator say that if you were really passionate, serious and competent, then you would have finished your project? As above, having the submitted version be formally complete as a document though you yourself know that you'd like to do more with it seems like a good idea.  "

We spoke about it in the most kindly possible way, now she says we are bullying her!  She is completely unprepared and we are starting to think that she lied to get accepted by our supervisor.

I've been faced with a similar situation before, although the dynamic was somewhat different, in that while officially of the same level as the person in question, I effectively was their mentor or \"secondary unofficial supervisor\". In that case, I had a duty to raise the concern with their formal supervisor (in an informal manner), to alert them to the concern. They were grateful at being alerted early to the situation, rather than being left out of the loop, although this will vary in different cases, depending on their (desired) level of involvement in the goings-on of the lab.  If someone is struggling though, I do feel that you have an academic responsibility to a colleague to offer assistance if appropriate, but that has obviously been done here, to the point of detriment of others' work.  If you have a good working relationship with the supervisor (I am presuming it is also your supervisor), you could probably bring this to their attention casually/informally, although this obviously may not be the case - I had a completely colleague-like relationship with mine, and would act as the main contact supervisor to his project students), and any problems or concerns (including with other graduate students, as I was the most experienced) would be raised. In that case however, this information was always understood to be simply to help them as much as possible.  Perhaps you could discuss the concerns with a (no doubt already aware) experienced colleague in the lab. I am presuming that there's someone who is generally looked up to for advice by those working there. I'm sure they would be happy to discuss the matter in private and advise (or perhaps talk to the supervisor if they have a good relationship with them).  "

This may sound like the most sexist question possible, but in some STEM courses/disciplines particularly with a low female quota this can be a large contributing factor to not getting used early to organizing your workloads and learning yourself. Because those male coeds who get along well with their stuff have little better to do than fall over themselves providing help and support in study groups.  Been there, done that, got no T-shirt (800 coeds starting with me, about 16 female students among them). Now depending on the college and courses you are in, you still need the skills and brains to pass. There are hard limits to how far you'll get just by being someone to look at. Which is not restricted to females, actually: it is well-known that taller and/or more self-confident men convey much more competency than their less visually gifted counterparts. But they are less likely to be the victim of unabating \"let me do as much for you as I can\" attack waves.  Whatever the reasons, it is becoming apparent that she is not well-prepared for the kind of workflow she is supposed to be part of. That does not have to mean she is dead baggage: one thing that comes to mind to me is oboists: one of the most time-consuming and exasperating part of playing that instrument is making your reeds. As an amateur, you easily spend an hour on a reed, and then it will work any amont of time from 5 minutes to several months. Several professional oboists have a side business of making reeds for amateurs. You can perfectly well perform on your instrument while never making a reed yourself. But it makes you dependent on the skills and availability of someone else. Of course, you'd not expect another colleague in your orchestra to make your reeds without compensation.  So at any rate, it is clear that your colleague here is not able to do her work without the involvement of others. That's a department and managing problem. You need to get together, figure out what is missing here, figure out what is required for jump-starting her into become productive in the manner expected in your department, figure out who can help with that in what manner and what effort, and figure out how to free the resources necessary to do that.  Basically there are three possible outcomes: a) she'll be more work than she gets done. This will not work out, separate. b) she'll require work on a continuing basis, but deliver more than one puts in. This requires proper work arrangements and understandings. One needs to evaluate whether the net benefit justifies the pay and the work disruption. c) she can develop into a productive member of your team once she gets over the culture shock and develops the necessary skills.  It is clear that this will not work without someone originally carrying some of the weight, and the self-organizing of that does not work well. Fingerpointing will not get this situation under control. Actively trying to fix this on a department level will keep the cost under control, will make it clear who needs to get credit and responsibility for carrying that initial cost, and will make it clear how to assess where one is getting.  This is an unproductive and aggravating situation for all of the involved. Conflicting plans, targets, and expectations are not going to help.  "

I think safest solution here is to let the supervisor know about the situation and let him/her handle the situation.  The point is, you are in a tough situation and I encourage you to act very wisely. You need to consider few aspects carefully.  For instance, be mindful of sexist behavior/bullying/humiliating. I am _not_ saying that you are being patronizing or any other accusations. However, experience is telling me these types of situations have good potentials for misinterpretations. For this reason, I believe it is wise to handle this situation through the senior staff sooner or later.  The rather difficult part here, is how bring this situation to your supervisor's attention. Perhaps you can directly tell them about the situation and ask them to handle it. This highly depend on the relationship you have with you supervisor and your position in the lab. Be sure that he/she knows that you have done more than enough to solve the situation in the lab.  Another solution would be involve the supervisors indirectly. For instance next time she comes with a new question, ask her to email it to you and CC the supervisor. If the answer to the question is very trivial your supervisor will automatically be alerted about the quality of new msc candidate. A better scenario would be that she will try to solve the problem herself, when she face the case of supervisor's involvement. You should carefully and delicately pass her to the supervisor.  Couple of notes:    1. She might be in a hard situation as well. New programming paradigm, new person in the town, just coming from bachelor, feeling a bit vulnerable, etc. Maybe, just _maybe_ , she is actually trying.   2. Do **NOT** assume she is lying. You are not in a position to judge her and this is a very strong accusation and quite unprofessional.  "

[Philip Guo's](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm) has written excellently on the topic and I recommend his post; I'll apply his idea to what you describe (which is a part of your actual case).  There are two explanations for the situation you described:    * she's indeed incompetent on stuff she should know (as you're assuming);   * she just happens to not know _bash_ and run into some obstacle learning it, but appropriate training would make her able to contribute. In which case, the (wrong) assumption \"how could one possibly not get that by oneself\" acts as a form of bullying. In fact, since women and minorities are less likely to know Unix culture, this attitude can easily be a source of discrimination (see [Philip Guo's post](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line-bullshittery.htm)).  And my HPCC experience was _full_ of `bash`-like tools with similar problems. (You only mention `bash` once, and `bash` is a bad offender, but lots of this answer is more generally valid).  > Whoever does programming knows this is a \"teach-yourself\" skill. Everytime a > problem arises, you search the wealth of tutorials and guides in Internet, > you ask in an specialized forum and the last resource is to consult a > colleague (everybody is very occupied with its own business).  I've learned programming that way (up to Linux-kernel-hacking level, in case you're tempted to dismiss me), but that's not the only one. For all skills, teachers exist to help overcome \"teach yourself\" obstacle.  > [...] She seems unable to go beyond very basic commands like executing a for > loop in a BASH script.  Does she ignore languages she was taught in her courses, or does she have trouble getting bash? In the second case, I have news for you: it's extremely easy to be a genius and not get bash. I'm a PhD student who does get bash, surrounded by many smart students who get it less, in a programming languages lab.  One key problem is that bash violates so many unconscious assumptions that are valid in \"sensible\" programming languages\u2014for instance, by lacking a parser. So that forgetting any space in `if [ -f \"$i\" ]; then` will result in unhelpful errors \u2014 and trying to get them will result in more frustration.  [As Philip Guo explains](http://www.pgbovine.net/command-line- bullshittery.htm):  > There is a huge disconnect between the elegant high-level ideas discussed on > the whiteboard (while presumably sipping cappuccinos) and the grimy, grungy, > terrible command-line bullshittery required to set up a computing > environment suitable for implementing those ideas in code. This gulf of > execution is tremendously frustrating for highly-capable and motivated > students who just didn't happen to spend 10,000 hours of their youth > wrestling with nasty command-line interfaces.  Now, you're not supposed to teach her this stuff \u2014 the professor should check one has the skills on entry or setup training. However, I don't see how one can _avoid_ unconsciously bullying somebody else with those misconceptions.  Now, how could it be that she has an issue with the whole lab? Guo answers again:  > OK here's what gets me super pissed. Many commenters presumed that \u201creal > programmers\u201d should be command-line experts...

I've had the same idea\u2014then being a PhD student gave overwhelming contrary evidence.  EDIT: Another insightful analysis of what's hard in learning POSIX (specifically, of the \"long tail\" problem) appears in an analysis of a completely different problem\u2014learning to cook for geeks.

In some cases where an advisor makes a more significant contribution than the student to the revised paper that is being submitted for publication (e.g. time/effort), their name can be first.  **For undergraduate theses** , I would guess that the students' names should appear first and advisor's name should appear last, if the thesis is not published but merely submitted to the university to fulfill the graduation requirements. However, when that thesis is revised for publication, the same rule as for graduate papers applies - if the advisor actually contributed more, their name can go first. Experienced, well respected faculty with tenure are not concerned with pushing their name, so more often than not they allow students to go ahead of them on the author list.  Finally, having your advisor go first on a revised thesis submitted to a conference or a journal **may not be a bad idea** , if your names are still on that paper. This still provides you acknowledgement for academic research and publication activity, so I would not worry too much if your name goes first or second or third.  It is an early effort in your research career, which will be superseded by more serious research work that you will do.

Also, the answer with the most votes places much less emphasis on undergrad research.  For admissions to most grad schools in math, undergrad research is neither necessary or expected (particularly published research--in fact, publications in good journals in math usually take a long time to get accepted, so the chances are low that you would have a good paper accepted by the time you apply for grad schools).  If there are specific problems that you want to research on your own, that's great, and as xLeitix says you should try to get a faculty member to help guide you. If however you just want to write a paper to help get into grad school, this may not be worth it. While research experience is good for your application (though may not be extremely helpful if it's not in math), you need to consider the opportunity cost.  What (let's say US PhD) admissions committees are looking for is evidence that you're talented, motivated and have solid preparation. Even if you've done some research, unless it's outstanding, if you don't have much advanced coursework, or didn't do well in abstract classes, you're probably in a worse position than someone in the opposite situation. The best preparation for grad school is taking a lot of advanced math classes and doing really well in them.  That said, it's great if you do your own research on the side if it's not at the expense of your coursework, and if you have a faculty to discuss things with, they can write you a recommendation letter that can mean a lot, whether you've published, or even submitted, something or not.

        "answer_body": "  In the US, TAships and RAships are generally assigned by the department. There may be a rule about first year students (ours was that 1st year students could not be assigned TAships). You should also not assume that the division is made by a committee. RAships can be grant-related, or funded by generic department funds. The PI would usually make the decision if a student is considered especially appropriate for the project (unless the PI has a lousy department that doesn't give him/her much autonomy). Depending on the level of democratic sentiment, either the chair decides on the allocation, an admissions / funding committee does, or the whole department faculty does. TAships are also subject to university rules, if any, or department policy, about language competence, so it may be impossible to grant an incoming student a TAship if their English isn't certified for oral proficiency.  Generally speaking, an RAship is better than a TAship from the student's perspective, but the department might either have a particular need for a TA (prehaps in a specific area) in that year, or it might be advantageous to have a year's teaching out of the way so that in your second year you can do something else. I would say that you should not over-interpret either outcome, if you checked the \"both\" box. \"Prefer\" means prefer.  "

        "answer_body": "  Here's the way I read one STEM department in the US that I have some insight into, but I'm also reading this through third-party comments and the experience of a few students I know, so take it with a grain of salt. RAs go to professors who have grant funding or startup funding to support them. If a student is admittable, but no professor puts their hand up to say they want to support them on an RA, then they may or not be actually admitted depending on how many TA slots are available and how the committee feels about them otherwise. There may be a handful of department-level or privately-funded RA fellowships available for really great students. Some students may be admitted with no funding, though I think this is unlikely for students explicitly applying for PhDs (more below).  I know of two separate cases where a student was rejected when no professor was willing to stick their hand up and offer them an RA during the committee meeting. In one of those cases, the student was admitted the subsequent year after publishing a few great papers and making a few contacts. The other student decided to do his PhD at another nearby school. I don't know what drives this difference between TA and RA admissions in this particular department, but it seemed clear that if you have someone who wants to work with you, you can surmount many admission obstacles, assuming they have funding. Not having a champion can also scuttle your chances. I think that some really top notch students must be \"claimed\" by professors based on their applications only, that is without prior contact with the prof, but I can't prove that and don't know how it works.  My strong impression, but more speculatively, is that some students are admitted to the master's program with no funding hoping to score a TAship along the way or impress a professor in one of their early courses and land an RA. After that, being admitted already, they will try to upgrade themselves to a PhD student along the way. I think a lot of the TA positions go to these students. This latter impression is based on the huge number of requests for RA positions I get in a non-academic research organization every year from MS students with no apparent funding.  Now with all that being said, students coming to this department with master's degrees already in hand appear to be at a disadvantage unless they have very strong CVs or prior contact with a prof that wants to work with them. That was the case with the two students I mentioned before.  "

If it doesn't particularly matter with respect to the finer details, it would be sufficient to provide the entire story in Arabic and then give a synopsis in English. If it's more critical that the audience knows what each line means, then give each sentence with its English gloss.  If you wanted to go to the extreme, you would have an interlinear gloss, which means that each word, or even morpheme, is glossed individually, and then a free translation given at the end. Here's a Hungarian example (from the Leipzig glossing rules):                Gila abur-u-n      ferma  hami\u0161alu\u01e7  g\u00fc\u01e7\u00fcna  amuq\u2019-da-\u010d.      now  they-OBL-GEN  farm   forever    behind  stay-FUT-NEG      \u2018Now their farm will not stay behind forever.\u2019        In linguistics we use these literally hundreds of times in a thesis, because this is where our data really is. It's probably more depth than you'd be willing to go into, and I would advise against it unless the Arabic syntactic and morphological features are absolutely critical to your thesis. The conventions that most linguists use (and tweak to their own subject language) with respect to the names of various grammatical features (OBL and GEN, for example) can be found in the [Leipzig Glossing Rules](http://www.eva.mpg.de/lingua/resources/glossing-rules.php).

If the data were transcriptions of interviews conducted in Arabic, and was not generally available to readers, then the data should be presented in its original form. This allows diligent readers to verify your conclusions.  For practical purposes (assuming the readership isn't a fluent Arabic-speaking population), a translation should be provided as well. Depending on the amount of material involved, you might present consecutive texts, first the Arabic and then the translation. If there is a lot of material, it may be best to put the original text in an appendix, unless issues of translation need to be discussed in the paper. For Arabic, there is also the question of _how_ to present the text, i.e. in Arabic script or in (augmented) Roman letters. For Classical and Modern Standard, there are standards that lead to interchangeability so it does not matter too much, but for Colloquial dialects it would matter how the data was created (did the subject write it, or was it spoken and someone transcribed it?). In the latter case, questions of accuracy are especially bound to come up (you can't write \u062b as \"th\" in a dialect where it is pronounced \"t\").  There is no need to translate personal names. If you intend to use a term such as \u0645\u0642\u0647\u0649 repeatedly, it should be translated the first time and transliterated all times (maqha\u0304).  "

If there are several subjects that equally interest them, they are probably equally likely to succeed in any of them. Now, there are things that happen with \"hot subjects\" and \"bubble bursts,\" and so on, but it's very hard to predict what will be going on in five to ten years from the beginning of a Ph.D. program. If you pick subject A over subject B for such a reason, then you are likely to be disappointed, and to have a lower chance of success because you haven't followed your heart.  Now, there is one major exception to this, and that is if you want to work outside of your home country and your field interacts with national strategic interests. For example, if you are an Iranian student in the United States and you want to study nuclear technology, then you are likely to come under close government scrutiny even as a graduate student and there will be many jobs that are simply unavailable to you unless you become a citizen. It is possible for this to go the other way as well: you may find yourself with some difficulty moving your work abroad from a country if it is considered sensitive. This can affect some unexpected areas: see, for example, [the battles over cryptography in the 1990s](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Export_of_cryptography_from_the_United_States).

That is, don't throw them into the water and see if they swim. Think a lot about what the expected outcome will be, and what the foreseeable steps, challenges and problems will be. Yes, this is a lot of work and means that you could (almost) \"do the work yourself\" in the same time, but for undergrads you can typically not yet expect that you can just drop them a research question and see them run with it.   * Have regular meetings. Make sure that there is progress, and if there isn't, make sure that you know what the blocking issues are. Don't expect them to necessarily come to you first with any issues. In my experience, undergrads often are a bit shy about asking for help, and sometimes get stuck on (for you) relatively easy problems unnecessarily.   * Make sure that you _would be able to do the project yourself given enough time_. I know that this is somewhat controversial, but for grad students, I am perfectly happy to accept projects where I myself wouldn't know how to do every part myself. That is, I expect a grad student to be able to solve her/his own problems. For undergrads, I do not do this. I want to be able to help undergrads in a meaningful way if they get stuck, technically.   * Conversely, make sure that the work is not just random grunt work. In my experience, the best way to make sure that the undergrad research project is _not_ interesting for the student is by letting them do something that everybody else either considers unimportant or terribly tedious to do. Undergrads are not yet experienced, but they are still colleagues and _not_ some sort of scientific minions.   * Somewhat related: make sure that you are excited about the project, or at the very least be able to convincingly pretend that you are. Again, having the feeling that nobody cares about their project is a surefire way to make for a terrible research experience.   * Integrate the undergrads into the lab. When there are talks, the undergrads are invited (i.e., expected to come). When the grad students are expected to regularly speak in the internal seminar, the undergrads need to do this as well. If there is a regular lab beer night, the undergrads are invited as well. If the lab usually goes to lunch together, the undergrads are asked to come along. You get the idea.   * If at all possible, give them a fixed work place in the lab, and require them to be there at least some percent of the time.  To summarize, the best undergrad projects in my lab always worked on a well- defined project, which was still an integral part of the research agenda for the lab that others were enthusiastic about. On concrete example from my research: some members of my lab are currently working on benchmarking compute cloud providers. That typically means hacking up some automation scripts, deploying benchmarks, gathering some data, and analysing the results. This is rather tedious and error-prone work. Hence, I got a computer science bachelor student to build a web-based platform, which students could use to define, schedule and execute benchmarks using a relatively simple DSL (domain-specific language). The platform the student built technically wasn't terribly complex, but the solution worked well, tackled a common community problem, and most importantly saved multiple grad students a ton of time. We also published the tool as open source software and wrote a small paper about it, allowing to student to go to a conference to another continent. During the conference, a number of professors asked the student for details on his tool, and expressed interest to also use it for their research.  "

Whether or not the publication is in a top-tier journal. Of course, I realize that the better a journal, the better. What I mean to say is, given that I have some work now (such as, for example, observing certain trends when a simulation is run on a high performance computing cluster, and explaining any anomalies that arise) which may be publishable in a non-top tier journal, and some other work (which works towards providing improvements to a recent paper) which _has a chance_ of faring better than a non-top tier journal, but which will take more time to get ready (say, 6 months more?), is it worth waiting for the completion of better paper (i.e., the paper which may get into a better journal)?    2. Like in 1, given a choice between publishing as a non-primary author now, versus publishing as a primary author later, should I wait to publish as a primary author later, and only then submit the journal in which I am not to be a primary author (assuming, of course, that the primary author has no issues with waiting).    3. Would it matter if one's first paper is in a journal or a conference? I have heard that it is better to send a paper in for a conference before a journal (especially for a first paper), since conferences tend to give much quicker replies. Am I correct?    4. Does the content of a first paper matter? Whether it is a review-based paper, a paper suggesting improvements to an already existing paper, or a paper submitting a reasonably novel idea? Assuming of course, that other methods or ideas would eventually be published, should I, say, wait to propose something more, umm... novel _ish_ first?  Long story short, **how much would my first publication (in terms of parameters such as reputation of journal, how much it goes towards improving knowledge in the field, whether or not I hold primary authorship and so on) affect my prospects (whether in the industry, or in the academia).**  NOTE 1: If it matters, this question is with specific reference to Computer Science (a little more to the applied side than to the theoretical side). Also, I am an undergraduate.   NOTE 2: By a journal of less repute/non-top tier journal, I do not mean to say a _disreputable_ journal, such as a predatory one, merely a journal with lower impact factors, higher rates of acceptance, et. al.

Frankly, all of these sound like nice things to have people think about you. My recommendation for any undergraduate is to not get hung up trying for a perfect first publication. Your first publications will probably either involve a lot of hand-holding or else be a pretty rocky experience, as you gain experience in writing publications and communicating with your scientific community. It's better to start writing and gaining that experience now, rather than saving it for a more painful experience with a larger and more significant work that you are more heavily invested in.  "

That's why it's important to make sure all students have an equal share of area or real property to build upon.  A six-line citation does not necessarily bring any advantage compared to a one-line citation. For that reason, I don't see why we should penalize students who had identified some information with more authors or a longer title; that is not how we teach them to examine the credibility of a paper.  If you're concerned about them citing too many things or citing mindlessly, you may put a limit on the number of citations like some journals do. However, I wouldn't include them in the word count.

I think that which way you go depends on what you want the students to learn. Some examples that would push you one way or another:    * If you want them to focus on prose, don't count citations in the length.    * If you want them to learn to express complicated thoughts concisely, use a short page limit and count citations (e.g., the IEEE six-page format)    * If you want them to focus on referencing, count citations and text separately.  Either way it shouldn't matter too much, because you're using a range and probably have some flexibility in how you apply your rubric, so you can adjust for common sense.  "

I find embarrassed, and don't know how to supervise him when I can't quite understand his project.  I know as a PhD student, learning new things is essential (and I enjoy a lots). However, I do not have the time now. The undergraduate needs to have some results in few weeks for some sorts of mid-term review report. I agree to supervise him because I don't want to reject my supervisor, I just join the group and it seems inappropriate to turn down.  What should I do in this situation?

In academic research, it is not uncommon that the one doing the actual project is more familiar with the material than the one supervising it. While it's probably rarely the case in an undergraduate - PhD student relation, it almost becomes the norm in the PhD student - professor relation, at least as the PhD student becomes more senior. Keep in mind that supervising is not only about teaching the material, but also about how to act and conduct research professionally. I hope you feel more confident about the latter aspect!  In your specific situation, there seem to be two possible steps if you feel you need to do something about it.    * Talk to the student you supervise, explain that your background is in a different field, and openly state that you may not be able to fully help on the content side of the project. If the student is sufficiently confident in working more independently, you should be able to be more relaxed as well.   * Otherwise, you may need to talk to your supervisor again and explain the problem. Maybe he can point out an additional member of the group who would be able to help with the aspects you can't cover.  "

      "question_body": "  Here's my situation: I'm a fourth-year undergraduate at an Asian university, and next semester, I'll be hoping to conducting research in order to publish a senior undergraduate thesis. Now, since my university doesn't really possess the facilities for research in the field I'm interested in, I applied to a lab in a university in the United States, and I've been accepted in and told that I can join up in February. It's a fantastic opportunity for me to gain relevant experience in a field I'm interested in, I can help out in a lab environment conducive for research in the field, and along the way, I can get my thesis done under a really brilliant professor as well. That's the good part.  The bad part is, I spoke to one of my university deans (the one in charge of coordinating senior undergraduate theses) earlier about this opportunity and my intentions to spend the next semester at that research lab, saying that this a fairly niche field, I'll be gaining a lot by spending a semester there and that I'll still be publishing my thesis here in my university.  He says that the new policy of the university administration is that they're unwilling to permit students to go out of the university and spend a semester abroad, and the reason behind this is that it's unfair for something like this to benefit just one student, and it has to help other students as well for them to sign off on something like this. The dean wants a formal understanding between the research lab and the faculty at my university, stating that the professor at the research lab would be willing to take qualified students from my university in upcoming semesters to work in his lab. There is apparently to be no communication between me and the professor in all this, and any potential trip of mine is to be entirely determined by my faculty.  Now, I get where the dean is coming from, considering it from the university's perspective. But opportunities like this don't come around very often, and I took immense efforts to obtain it. Why should my potential achievements be determined by how much they benefit other students? It's a bit like saying, _if you want a job, everyone has to get a job as well._  More importantly, how could I possibly get the professor at the research lab to agree to this 'formal understanding'? He does not take undergraduate students very regularly in his lab, and to suddenly impose this proposal on him, would almost certainly make him hesitate about allowing me to spend a semester at his lab, all due to no fault of my own. How could he possibly agree to taking in other students in the future, when he doesn't know my university very well and the type of students in it?  At the same time, I don't want to antagonize the administration at my university either. What do I do, and where do I go from here?  ",

If you don't mention it at all, and somehow it turns up later on, it will raise more red flags than if you at least mention it in passing.  "

I need only some of this money to pay off my university fees and living costs, since I have wonderfully generous parents.  The research projects I work on officially revolve around applied problems in math biology. Lately, I have been interested in [Baez's work on \"network theory\"](http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/networks/networks_1.html), but because of full course load, along with the research project I am responsible for, I don't have the time to explore these ideas as I'd like to.  I have some ideas for pure math projects that involve extending Baez's nascent network theory ideas to problems in biology. I also have some ideas for tools that could be made in order to help a researcher formally analyze interaction systems.  These ideas are completely tangential to my own work (for the moment), although if I were able to set up the groundwork for them to the point where I am able to see that they do have potential, I'd love to bring it up with my professor.  One idea I have had recently is that I could hire my own \"research assistants\" out of my stipend (I am allowed to spend it as I like, right)? I could provide them with my motivations, and give them \"guidance\" (I don't know how capable I would be of this) through ongoing communication. This way, I would be able to explore my ideas, even if I don't personally have the energy and time to see them through right now. The alternative of course, is that I buckle up and find time from _somewhere_ (e.g. by not writing this post) to work on the ideas, or put them away for a later date when I do have time.  So, is hiring my own research assistants at this time ethically questionable?  ",

You know research is really, really expensive right? People like Ph.D. students - and yourself - do it for cheap out of extreme valuing of their own educational and research experience.  You can't provide a six figure salary (what an industry researcher costs), you can't hire out your own research passions to someone; you have no play.  This, in theory, comes up in the professional world too. As a rule you can't really hire someone better than you to solve your problems... you'll run out of budget for them as they bleed your personal checkbook, or they'll get hired and take over your work (which is probably very bad for you). There's no \"ethics\", it stops at the pragmatics.  I think the ethics of this are kind of a moot point because there's cultural reasons this can't really come up. A more practical ethical question might be if you can hire researchers to work on parts of your project for you. That's a pretty different question, but I'm pretty sure the answer is yes, that's what a research budget is for (and your undergraduate underlings would of course appear as co-authors, which is a big part of why they took the opportunity).

The question is what your 'staff' will be doing for you.

Perhaps, as a compromise, if your advisor can promote you to a role that would take into account another researcher, e.g. senior undergraduate researcher, then probably this would work well.

Another option would be to upload it to a repository such as [figshare.com](http://figshare.com/), where it will also be assigned a DOI and it will be easier for people to cite (and discover?).    2. **Making a journal article out of it**  This option will be harder, but will also probably benefit you much more. I'm assuming that you know how a journal article looks like, so now your job is to make it look like one. The technical aspects may be challenging at first, but they are pretty straightforward. Every journal has a \"guide for authors\" section where they instruct you exactly how and where to submit the article. What format to use, how to draft the figures, what citation format to use, etc. If you are not sure which journal to publish to, I suggest that you look on the citation list of your own thesis and see which journals published articles similar to yours. One of the reasons that this option is harder is because you have to convince the editors and reviewers of the journal that the article is novel, important, well written and worth publishing. The article will be subject to peer review which will require additional time and effort from your side. It is a lengthy process and can take several months.  "

I don't really have research in the sense that I haven't published anything, and I don't believe anything I've done to be particularly novel. The school I went to was a teaching college, there wasn't a strong emphasis on research.  That said, I have been known (as my recommendation-writing professors will surely vouch) to do projects wherein I pick a topic, read a bunch about it, and then implement what I've read about. At present, I'm writing a ray-tracing renderer, and I plan to implement a lot of advanced features by the time I actually apply to grad school, such as photon mapping and an BVH data structure. I also plan to implement a few more shiny bells and whistles based on techniques I've read from different SIGGRAPH papers, but I don't believe I will be doing anything that no one else has done before, especially in the 4 months left until my application is submitted.  For what it's worth, however, this project is 100% my own. I never took a graphics class while in college. I work 40 or more hours a week a software developer, and I do most of my work by waking up at 5:30AM and working until I start work at 9. I do most of my research (into papers and topics) when I get home, and during the work day when I have a few minutes.  My question is, how valuable is the information I just listed? Does the attitude demonstrated above make up for the fact that I don't really have terribly original research? What about the fact that my professors probably aren't that well known?  This applies mostly to the top tier of schools. I will be applying to several non-elite schools as well, but it is with the top schools that I am most worried about my lack of research. Do I have even a small chance to get into a top school, or am I simply noncompetitive as a candidate?  \\-- As for work experience, I have 8 months of experience as an intern at a fairly high profile research institute, but the truth is the work they had me do while there really wasn't research.

I don't think anyone can say for sure except the committee members, but it's definitely possible.  I was accepted with a few independent research projects, none of which had any real \"results\". What I did (YMMV) was review the literature and come up with incremental modifications or advancements, or in one case an experiment for which the outcome was pretty obvious but which had never actually been performed.  In my interviews, the emphasis was not even the details of these projects, but how I could relate the skills I had gained to the topics my potential advisers were interested in. As Dylan mentioned, even top programs don't require that incoming students are already accomplished researchers (what would be the point of attending?) but that you show initiative and capacity for research.  My advice then, would be to use the 4 (+- 1) months you have until you submit to spin your implementations into independent research projects. Try to push just past the limits of the research you reviewed. If possible, you should document these projects by submitting technical reports somewhere (e.g. your undergrad dept. might be able to assign a technical report number and host the document).  But even if you can't do that, try to clarify in your own mind how the experience of independent study might have prepared you for research, so that you can communicate that effectively. Good luck!  Oh I almost forgot, everything I have ever read about non-research work experience indicates it's basically unimportant... however, if you happen to apply to non-CS programs that need programmers and you have work history showing your ability to build non-trivial programs it could be a significant advantage. This might backfire if your adviser wants you more as a programmer than a researcher, but nevertheless it could help you get in.  "

      "question_body": "  I am a European student applying for a PhD in mathematics in the US. Browsing the internet, I have come across quite a lot of American PhD applicants claiming that they have several years of research experience, or even publications. I am rather astonished because in Europe first research attempts normally begin when a student is writing his or her Master's thesis. On the other hand the level of mathematics taught in European undergrad programmes is typically higher than in the US an normally involves courses which are classed as graduate courses in the US. Therefore I would like to ask the following questions:    1. What does \"undergraduate research\" really mean in most cases? Original research, contribution to a senior mathematician's original research through some calculations/programming work, independent study of a difficult topic + a paper/report but without any original findings?    2. Am I right being skeptical that someone who has only taken some courses in linear algebra, real analysis, etc. is ready to do research?    3. US PhD programmes typically involve 2 years of taught courses and a qualifying exam prior to beginning the work on one's thesis, i.e. research proper. Is undergraduate research really an important prerequisite in the eyes of the admissions committee?    4. How common is it to have publications as an undergraduate in the US?    5. As a student coming from Europe, where there is little opportunity for undergrad research and it is generally not encouraged, is my application at an disadvantage? While I have not done any \"undergrad research\", I have done a lot of independent work. I have written a Bachelor's thesis, given talks at many seminars, and am now working on a Master's thesis which will hopefully contain some original results. Can this experience be regarded on a par with a US applicant's research experience?  ",

        "answer_body": "  To address a few of your points.    1. There is no standard definition of undergraduate research. In many US universities one can graduate with a degree _without_ doing an independent thesis, so in effect it is possible to obtain a bachelor's degree without having anything resembling \"research experience\". Therefore some people would be generous and count the research for bachelor's theses as \"undergraduate research\". For some people the phrase excludes theses but includes REU experiences, and for some only original research leading to publications count.   It is not too unreasonable to expect that the work put into independent projects, even an undergraduate thesis that basically is just a review of existing results, can be beneficial to graduate research.    2. Yes; but where did you get the idea that undergraduates only learn some linear algebra and real analysis? Combinatorics is a field in which the barrier to entry is somewhat lower, and is especially approachable to the Math Olympiad types; and discrete mathematics is certainly on the rise in the past decade or so in terms of undergraduate education. And many undergraduates do have quite a bit more under their belt than you seem to believe.   Having worked in Europe for the past 5 years, I feel comfortable asserting that the claim  > the level of mathematics taught in European undergrad programmes is > typically higher than in the US an normally involves courses which are > classed as graduate courses in the US.  is not quite true. What is true is that the mathematics in European undergraduate programs often _start out_ at a higher level and with more rigour, but at the advanced undergraduate level the US schools usually have caught up. (Note also that the US degrees are usually 4 years compared to 3 years in Europe, so they have a bit more time to build.) Couple that with the liberal arts tradition you'll often find elective classes at the top level of undergraduate education in the US which have no analogue at all in Europe.  While it is certainly true that good European universities offer undergraduate courses that are at the level of graduate courses in mediocre US universities, the reverse swapping European/US is also true.    3. It depends on the answer to (1). The rare individual who actually did original research and obtained publishable results will likely get some bonus points when the admission committee deliberates, but it is certainly not a norm and one is not expected to have done such necessarily.     4. I don't have any statistics. Hearsay suggests that original research leading to something published in a research journal is somewhat rare. (Publications resulting from REU or similar programs, or publications in undergraduate journals are less rare.)    5. If your master's thesis contains original results, then you are likely more than on par with the typical applicant to US PhD programs, in terms of research experience.   "

        "answer_body": "  > Is undergraduate research really an important prerequisite in the eyes of > the admissions committee?  It's certainly not mandatory: every US graduate program in mathematics is willing to admit students who have not done original research or published a paper. On the other hand, having impressive accomplishments helps, and it's important to have letters of recommendation from faculty who have seen you engage deeply with something difficult. It's easier to get such a letter from a supervisor on a substantial independent project, but it doesn't have to be a research project. Your background as described in the question sounds strong, and I don't think you need to worry about a lack of research experience.  The worrisome scenario is someone who has never focused on any question for more than a few hours. This is entirely possible for an undergraduate who hasn't written a thesis or worked on any comparable project. The problem is that doing mathematics on a long time scale is qualitatively different from short-term problem solving. It's psychologically different: you need to be patient and flexible, while still maintaining focus over months or years. Some people are effective and enthusiastic over short time scales but aren't temperamentally suited to research, and it can be a heavy blow to discover in graduate school that you don't enjoy this sort of work or have trouble focusing. Other people are intimidated by the idea of research and assume they would be worse at it than at short-term problem solving, while in fact they might be much better.  So the key advantage of undergraduate research is that it gives students a chance to discover their preferences and talents, with faculty mentors who can judge their performance and vouch for it. On the other hand, there are other ways to achieve the same goals, and it's the goals that matter.  Historically, the initial push for undergraduate research in the US was actually as a recruiting tool. The idea was that encouraging students to do research would help uncover people who should go to graduate school but might not have realized it (either from being underconfident or from not having had the opportunity to shine). REUs were not intended as a prerequisite for graduate school, but this view has become more common among applicants as the programs have become more popular.  > What does \"undergraduate research\" really mean in most cases? Original > research, contribution to a senior mathematician's original research through > some calculations/programming work, independent study of a difficult topic + > a paper/report but without any original findings?  Preferably one of the first two, and ideally the first, but it is sometimes used to refer to the third as well. Both applicants and supervisors have incentives to describe work as \"undergraduate research\" regardless of whether they intended or tried to do original research, in the hope that it will sound more impressive than just saying it was an independent project. This broader usage gets on my nerves, so I'd recommend against it, but it's widespread enough that there's not much risk of standing out as being misleading or manipulative.  > How common is it to have publications as an undergraduate in the US?  It's relatively common among those who attend an REU or similar research program, although the publications are not necessarily impressive in absolute terms (i.e., not taking into account that the authors are undergraduates). Publishing is rare among undergraduate students who have not participated in such a program.  "

I had worked with this professor previously (on a research topic that led to my summer research topic) and had great results.  This professor had very specific ideas as to what he wanted me to do and what goals I should accomplish. I was fine with this as previously this method had worked well with us. This is important; I'll explain in a second.  This summer, my professor (for lack of a better phrase) suddenly dropped off the face of the Earth. He stopped responding to my emails, and the few times he did respond (maybe twice in the span of three months) it was merely saying \"I'm very busy; we'll speak eventually; I'm working on other things that are much more important\".  This put me in a very bad place. I had done what he asked me and had at that point committed a fair amount of time to the direction he had asked me to pursue. I didn't have enough direction to keep going unsupervised, and didn't have enough time to go in a new direction that I could manage by myself.  I need to write up a summary that discusses what I did and my findings. What I have is a methodology that should solve a particular problem faster (in theory) than current methods (To be more specific, it's a faster implementation of an algorithm--unfortunately I couldn't improve the algorithm itself). I did not have enough guidance (or access to my funds for equipment) to actually test my theory.  Part of receiving the funds was a requirement that I present my findings in my school's undergraduate research journal. Is what I have really enough to present? I know it's an undergraduate journal so no one will actually read it, but I feel silly presenting something so small and trying to trump it up as an actual scientific accomplishment.  Do I try to present the small amount I found? Will I look like a giant idiot if I present a methodology that is completely untested as findings?  ",

I will do my best to address several of your concerns:  You are right that \"a faster implementation of an algorithm\" is not something very remarkable by itself. There are two possible interpretations:    * Your algorithm does the same thing as the previous algorithm, but you have either changed the insides of the algorithm or performed a better analysis and you have got a better time bound on the algorithm. In this case, I believe it should be okay to publish in an undergraduate journal.    * The algorithm is still the same, but you have discovered a flaw in some implementation of the algorithm and corrected this flaw, so the running time actually corresponds to what the original time complexity bound promises. This is more literally \"a faster implementation of an algorithm\", and by itself is not a large contribution.  The usual methodology in Computer Science for measuring complexity of algorithms is either worst-case complexity, average-case complexity or amortized complexity. You seem to suggest that you have some novel kind of methodology. If that methodology is more useful for some practical problem which you set out to solve, I believe this might be definitely something to include in the publication.  It is difficult for me to estimate the amount of novel work that you actually have, but you seem to suggest that it was a requirement to submit to an undergraduate journal. Therefore, it makes sense to me that you should write up your work regardless and try to submit it.  It is not the end of the world if a grant fails, but you should try and fulfill the requirements regardless. If you do submit, it may happen that your work does not get accepted, but if you fail to submit, this becomes a certainty.  "

        "answer_body": "  I will talk about publishing as an undergraduate in a general sense. This may change depending on your field of study, where and how the work is published(journal, conference, workshop, etc) and what your level of contribution to the end product will be.  Let's start with the easy question. \"Is this good for my career?\" I don't know of many fields where having published work, perhaps especially as an undergraduate, is a detriment. As an undergraduate with two publications as first name (in my field the student/person who contributed the most / drove the ground level work is first name, the professor is last name and the names in the middle can range from \"was vital to the success of the paper\" to \"they pushed a button a couple of times\") and several acknowledgements having those papers gave me a definite leg up against my peers when it came time to search for jobs. Having publications under your name can be invaluable if you choose to apply to grad school but companies are often very interested to see what high-level, field-acknowledged work you have completed. It definitely makes you stand out in a crowd.  It may seem like nothing but puppies and rainbows but there's a darker side as well. Academic publishing is a lot of work. Depending on your level of contribution this can mean weeks of brutal work rerunning experiments, tweaking inputs/outputs, editing and documenting. Most of the people I know, their first paper was a brutal experience because Academic writing is unlike any other writing you have done and there can be a steep learning curve in both the technique and the tools. So, unless you have a burning desire for a publication for publication's sake, the deciding factors for you should be:    1. What is my expected contribution?    2. How and where will I be credited?   3. What are my obligations if the publication is accepted?  Let's break these down.  **What is my expected contribution?**  In my field a couple of professors coming up to you after the fact and saying \"We are looking to get this published\" is a bit weird. I'm assuming that these professors were in some way involved in the work as mentors or that this an extension of their work. It is unlikely that this work is fit to be published in its current state. That's not meant as a slam towards your work, rather it's a response to the specifics of publication. Academic publication is often fairly stringent in style and method. It is likely that parts of your work will need to be tweaked or polished for publication(this really depends on your field to be honest) and, in some cases, completely redone. It is **very** important for you to demand, in a nice way of course, a roadmap for what needs to be done to get this work published and what you will be expected to do. At that time you should also try to find out how much of the final publication will be your work vs work from others/the group at large. If you have graduated and are starting a new job or heading off to grad school you may have other demands on your time. Writing an academic publication, especially your first academic publication, can be a serious time sink. This will play into the next part...  **How and where will I be credited?**  Is your work going to be placed, whole cloth, into a template and submitted? Then you should expect to be first author(or your field's equivalent) and be given an appropriately large share of the credit. Is your work going to be used as a subsubsection, comprising all of 2 lines in the final publication? Then the credit to you should be, appropriately, smaller. But that's simplifying things a bit - author order and credit/acknowledgements should be explicitly discussed early in the process. Get it out on the table and nail it down because differences in expectations can definitely damage professional relationships which, to be honest, is probably the most valuable thing you will get out of this. Things like original contribution level, publication writing/editing contribution level, and time/effort commitment to the project should be taken into consideration. Additionally consider your future plans - are you planning on publishing again? Are you looking at going to grad school? Depending on the answers to these questions you may find that the most valuable things you get out of publishing are the experience of publishing and the strong network connections you forge with your coauthors.  **What are my obligations if the publication is accepted?**  This is the final piece of the puzzle. If your publication is a conference or workshop piece then someone will have to present at the conference/workshop. It should, ideally, be one of the primary contributors. If that person is you, will you be able to attend? Who will pay for travel and fees? Even beyond traveling for conferences/workshops - Who will pay for submission fees? Recently one of my papers was 3 pages over the limit (the conference accepted longer papers at a fee for each additional page up to 5 additional pages). This cost almost $400 (on top of the original submission fees). If this occurs who will pay? If the publication is accepted what does that mean about your ownership of the results of your work? If additional work is done on the project how will it be funded? It is likely that your professor(s) or your institutions has grants for all of this. But you need to find out before you agree to anything. Finally, the question a lot more people should ask, what happens if the publication isn't accepted? Will you be involved in making changes and attempting a different venue? How will the group handle revisions (which, with finished work, can be brutal as you're coming back to the submitted work several months after it was submitted and making changes)?  All of this might seem like a bunch more questions to ask than answers but, really, that's the point. There are plenty who will disagree with me but, in my experience, the research was the easy part. Publishing is the hard, nasty, and occasionally obnoxious part(though it is pretty awesome too). In order to make the publishing part easier you need to have a clear plan for how you will turn this work into a publication and what everyone's expectations are.  I both love and hate my publications. As an undergraduate they gave me a definite edge over my peers in both grad school applications and the job market. I ended up with some very strong connections in my academic community that I can still leverage today. I am still involved as a researcher in my lab. On the flip side my first paper was a special kind of hell. It was two straight weeks of 20 hour days as we pushed to turn finished work into a publication before the deadline. I didn't sleep at all for the last 3 days of the push. My second paper was still brutal, but overall much better as I had passed the worst of the learning curve. I actually got some sleep leading up to that one. I'm incredibly proud of my work but, to be honest, doing those publications pushed me away from graduate school. They were a valuable experience in the world of academic publishing which, it turns out, is not something I enjoy enough to make it my career.  **TL;DR:** Make a list of questions, email/meet with your advisors/mentors, and flesh out the answers to those questions. If they're largely satisfactory - go for it!  **EDIT** Given your additional information. Unless they mean publish it on webspace they(or the university) controls OR as a book there is almost no way I can see a 40k word transcript being published as is. My rough estimates put that to be about 100 - 120 pages. I've not seen more than a handful of published papers (etc) over 20 pages long and most are under 10. This may mean they want to publish a portion of it or an heavily edited version of it. This adds a new question for you to ask, what do they mean by 'publishing'?  "

Another possibility in some cases is to simplify or modify your problem formulation to something that lends itself more easily to a closed form solution.  Reading the literature surrounding the problem is a good way to become familiar with what kinds of contributions are considered useful in this area.

        "answer_body": "  There's a subtle shift in the meaning of research as you transition from high school and lower-level undergraduate work to graduate school.  Early on, a teacher may ask for you to do research, and it means: Look up everything you can find on this matter, and report what you have found. You are essentially writing a \"research report,\" summarizing what is already known about a certain topic.  As you get into more formal academic research, however, _research_ means: Come up with a problem that hasn't been satisfactorily solved, form a hypothesis on how to solve it, then test your hypothesis with a series of carefully crafted scientific experiments, and finally report your results. You are essentially expanding the scope of knowledge in a certain field, and doing so using the scientific method.  It's also worth noting that the first section of most research papers summarize the already-established knowledge in the problem area. So, in a research paper about fiber optic networks in Africa, the author(s) would probably have some novel idea about how best to, say, install or maintain such a network, and they would likely begin by summarizing what has already been done so far, before explaining why their idea would potentially improve the start-of-the-art. Therefore, it's very **normal** to find other related papers when you start doing your research. In fact, that should be your first step: read and study every one of them you can find.  If you are doing a \"research report,\" that's pretty much the end of the line. But if you are doing graduate-level research, that's merely the beginning. Incidentally, it can easily take a year or more to do the rest (even longer if you are doing doctoral research).  "

Clearly from your question and comments this isn't a stapler thesis: this isn't a case where you and the PhD candidate have co-authored papers, where your work would be in the thesis and explicitly attributed to you.  In your other comments, you make it clear that you have written passages that are in her thesis. That goes way beyond just doing collaborative research. If it's in the student's PhD thesis as her own writing and her own research, then she is falsely representing that she's done the research, and she's falsely representing that the thesis is all her own writing.  In any university that I knew of up til now, that would result in the thesis being failed.**  I think you need to find out the rules of your university pretty quickly, because although the PhD candidate will get the worst of the enforcement, you could get hurt by this. This is now your responsibility to put right, for your own sake. That's because if it is against the rules, then you have unwittingly been complicit with the PhD student in what, upon submission of the thesis, would be the breaking of those rules. I think ignorance of the rules is unlikely to be taken as innocence in any ensuing disciplinary proceedings. At best you could make a case of being led astray by trusted colleagues, but that's going to damage your relationship with them. It is possible, as things stand, to extricate yourself from this situation without too much damage.  So don't go to the candidate or her supervisors to ask for their interpretation of the rules yet (if at all). Find and read the relevant rule yourself. They are almost certainly on your university intranet, if not the outward-facing website; failing that, ask in the university library.  Here, for example, is the rule for PhDs at University College London (UCL):  > The work in the thesis submitted by a student must be their own work and the > submission of a thesis for examination will be regarded as a declaration of > that fact.  The thesis may include collaborative work, but this should be stated as such, and must be written up by the PhD candidate, not the collaborator(s).  If, as I suspect, co-authorship of a PhD thesis at your university is not allowed, then you need to insist to the PhD student and her supervisors that the passages you've written be removed from the thesis. Do it gently, politely, in a collegiate spirit, but do it unambiguously. As you've done genuinely new research, you'll be submitting the words you've written to a journal, so tell them that - that should be enough for them to be sure to remove it from the thesis. Keep the paper trail of all of this (including the emails or other records of when you've sent your material to the PhD candidate in the past), to protect yourself.  * * *  ** though through the comments below, I've learnt that the University of California in San Diego does allow some co-authoring, providing advance permission from the Dean of Graduate Studies has been obtained.

It is fine (and encouraged) for PhD students to ask others to proofread or edit their writing. Out of courtesy, she should acknowledge your assistance in an appropriate part of the thesis (usually a special page near the beginning). But you should be doing this either as a personal favor to her, or in exchange for money; other than that, there is nothing in it for you. It isn't something that would likely interest an admissions committee (though you could certainly list that you did it, as it does give you a little extra exposure to professional writing).  As to the substantive research and writing contributions, there are possible ethical issues. You should talk to the PhD student and make sure that she has told her advisor and her committee about your contributions, and that they are okay with it. You should also ask about any special procedures that the university might have for including collaborative work. (For instance, at my PhD institution, they would need a signed letter from you confirming which parts were yours.) If you get _any_ sense that she might not be following all the rules, or that she may be intending to pass off the work as her own, you should go to her advisor and explain everything. (Ideally, you have already been talking to her advisor, since he or she presumably is the ultimate supervisor of your research work.) The fact that some of the text was actually written by you will invite the most scrutiny, so be sure this is clear to everyone.  She should certainly describe your contributions, very specifically, in the acknowledgements. If the thesis work is going to be published in a paper, depending on the level of your contributions, you might be entitled to coauthorship on that paper. You should discuss these authorship issues with the student now (e.g. who will be first author, etc), but you might also want to talk with some other faculty member, since it sounds like you may not have enough experience to know what is reasonable or customary in your field.  In the short term, the way you would get \"credit\" for your work, for the purposes of graduate admissions, is to get a letter of recommendation from the student, as well as from her advisor or whichever other faculty member is supervising your research. They can tell the admission committee in detail about what you did, and how they think it reflects on your research potential; that's likely to be even more helpful than being able to point to a part of a paper or thesis as yours.

I intend to apply to grad schools(Ph.D) a year after graduation, possibly to the top EE programs in the US (MIT, Berkeley, Stanford...) Despite the fact that ground-breaking/stellar research is virtually impossible to come by for undergraduates in my country, I have sort of gathered some. I have an accepted poster presentation(based on independent research) at the major national conference in my field, and my present senior year thesis/project may yield three-five papers at IEEE conferences around Africa. I should also be able to get two publications(also independent research) in a continental journal which is popular only among African Engineers in my field and not much outside.  My degree is a five year bachelors programme interspersed with three internships/co-op experience. One was a summer spent in a local R&D electronics lab/company in which we completed several design projects although all were adaptations/imitation of existing projects to solve problems facing developing societies like ours. Another one was a long internship (~8mths) in the EE division of a world-renowned company with huge presence in my country during which I worked on a major design project which required a lot of technical knowledge and was evaluated. I have also done some remote/virtual research for a foreign, not well-known, research institute in my field and I have completed a technical report (no peer review) of my research(not particularly breath-taking) which they publish in their report series.  My gpa though not near-perfect is on a 'first-class' (we use the british system) and so I am a high-ranking student in my university. We do not use the four point system and as much as I would not like to compare apples with oranges, if I convert my cgpa to the 4.0 scale it is just over 3.6 although our scale is much larger and high-end grades are more difficult to attain than what is obtainable in the US system. I am also a recipient of several national awards/recognition for academic merit.  Given the aforesaid and also assuming that I ace the GRE (math especially since I'm in engineering), my questions are these:  How do you think I can improve my chances of being a good fit for top U.S. graduate schools noting the difficulty/impossibility in doing any ground- breaking research especially as an undergraduate here?

I'm going to assume that the U.S. admissions committee at a top university would likely see you as an \"average\" student, rather than a \"top\" student (relative to other top university students). In this case, their question will be, would we rather train another \"average\" student for e.g. Silicon valley, or a similar student for an African country. The answer is likely to be in favor of the latter, because even top U.S. universities have limited points of entry into most African countries.  The hottest ticket in American universities right now is a degree from Kuwait, Qatar, or one of the other Gulf countries, with Africa not far behind. In this regard, your coops and internships with a national conference will be very helpful, because they suggest that you will rise high in your government's scientific hierarchy. American universities will be evaluating you as a potential Transportation Minister or head of the National Scientific Institute.  In this regard, your competition is not with \"western\" students, but similarly connected and educated African students (perhaps others from your homeland). You seem to have the advantage in this group. Good luck.  "

        "answer_body": "  Ok, good question, but let's eliminate the phrase, \"noting the difficulty/impossibility in doing any ground-breaking research especially as an undergraduate here?\" This actually applies to almost the entirety of the undergraduate population. Very few undergraduates work on ground-breaking research projects -- and, if they do, their role on the actual project is unlikely to be the intellectual driver. They might have done some lower-level work under the supervision of the principal investigator (PI).  So, your question is really about how to improve your chances of acceptance in general. That really depends on the discipline, and it really depends on the program to which you are applying. Every program has a unique admissions committee that will review applications and assign different levels / weights to factors they consider important in making admissions decisions. Thus, certain programs may place a lot more emphasis on GRE than other programs. Some programs might consider letters of recommendations to be very important, which other programs may consider letters of recommendation to be of little importance (since most letters of recommendations are cherry picked from the possible letter writers).  That said, your task is to tailor every application to the programs where you are submitting an application. A general snowball approach where you submit the same application everywhere is an alternative strategy, but one that I advise against. Learn what those programs value most in their admissions decisions, and tailor the application accordingly. Of course, it is hard to figure out what they value, so you have to do a lot of researching -- e.g., any published data on the current and previous cohorts?  Good luck!  "

It's not so much that I don't know how to organize my thoughts; in fact, I've written a very detailed outline. I seem to have a two questions I'm wrestling with (I apologize if this is a tad long-winded)    1. The monotonous proof-theorem-proof-theorem style that essentially consists of a list of facts with no exposition seems to be most accepted. But will this really make my paper stand out?

By no means am I writing a textbook, but I need to show the audience (namely admission committees) that I _know_ what I'm talking about. On the other hand, I have a deadline! There's always this looming thought in the back of my head that says \"But you can't leave that out!\" when I debate if I should skip something just to speed up the process -- it's as if I have a hoarder living in my head.

        "answer_body": "  My current field is not mathematics, but I am certainly not a real stranger to the field as I did my diploma (undergrad + masters) education on applied mathematics. Anyways here's my two cents:    1. The regular structure and tone of research articles is pretty much the same; unless there is a good reason you stick to IMRaD (Intro, Mat&Met, Results and Discussion). Unless there is a good reason, you avoid passive tone, and changes in tense etc. This structure has the benefit of being familiar and intuitive to practically anyone out there. The \"RaD\" part is typically what's most important.   What's different in **your** case is due to the fact that research om mathematics is more _inductive_ than _deductive_. What that means is that you have to make sure your introduction is watertight, all your assumptions are valid. Since the value of your results depend on what you have built them on, the introduction becomes much more important than a \"normal\" introduction.  Regarding the tone or style; the reason why some people can write witty is most likely because the same person has written many more articles, perhaps even book chapters. The experience really shines through in academic writing. Besides an established/respected professor isn't likely to be judged for humor in writing, the same way a junior scientist would be.  Alternatively the person in question might be \"witty\" in his/her personality, and that wittiness passes on to the writing. As a young, aspiring academic you should be more worried about getting it **_right_** than getting it pretty/witty.    2. It's usually hard to decide on that sort of stuff without having any more information. How much did you write? How much work are you presenting in that paper? It's usually a good idea to stick to the upper limit for the paper. Any journal (in my experience) will give you an upper limit on number of words/characters/pages for manuscript submission. I can only imagine admission committees would do the same. If there really isn't a defined limit, ask a more experienced colleague/friend perhaps, or a professor?   Hope it works out fine.  "

        "answer_body": "  Apologies for stealing scaaahu's comment into this answer, but I wanted to stress that it is really the only possible answer to this question: ask your advisor!  Getting a hang for the appropriate level of detail is a very tricky thing, and only comes with experience. Also with being clever and witty; if you can pull it off, great, but if you can't, then it distracts from the content of your article. There are no general rules for this, you need advice from a more experienced mentor.  If I were you, I would write up a quick draft without stressing _too_ much over these issues, and go over it carefully with your advisor; they would be able to tell you whether your humour is working, or where you need more or less detail.  That said, a few general tips:    1. Look at the papers you cite; if they all treat some theory as standard or well-known (\"By class field theory....\") then you probably can too. Same goes for tone.    2. Often you can save space and omit details by rephrasing your results in a way that suggests how the proof should go. For example, let's say I have a lemma about a linear operator that gets proven by choosing a basis and then something straightforward; I might then state the lemma in terms of the matrix, so it would be more obvious to the reader how to complete the proof.     3. (and the most important, imo) Engaging papers are not engaging because of witty one-liners, they are typically engaging because a great deal of effort went into organizing them well. The key is to ensure the reader always knows where they are, where they are going, and how they're getting there. This is not at all easy to do, but if you practice writing with this in mind early on, it will serve dividends later.  "

The trick is to learn to look at it with fresh eyes. **The main problem is not that the research did not conclude as you had hoped, the main problem is that you're letting it affect your confidence**. Find a new perspective. It may not have yielded what you thought it did, but you did the work and you found stuff out. Now figure out how to present it:    * Forget about the original expectations. Those tend to make for bad science. Look at your research so far, and pick out what's interesting, and why it's interesting.

        "answer_body": "  Regarding your first question: undergraduate research projects are a great way to experience some aspects of doing research, but deadlines are one way in which they differ from research in graduate school or beyond. So you shouldn't worry about the mere fact of not meeting your deadline. I can tell you that I set deadlines for myself all the time, and they always seem easily achievable, but then I often don't actually achieve them. Also I often think I should be able to prove some result in a certain amount of time, but then for whatever reason I'm not able to. So I turn that around and decide that my intuition must have been wrong, and in fact the result is more difficult than I expected; and I see this as progress since I've advanced my understanding, and I further try to identify what was the specific reason why my intuition was wrong.  Also, one great feature of the long-term research that is done in graduate school or beyond is that there is lots of flexibility to change the direction of a project mid-stream, or to pause the work on a project and finish a side project, or to split a large project into several papers, or to decide at a certain moment that the work has reached a stage where it's natural to publish what you've done so far, even though you'll keep working on it further. This type of flexibility is missing in a short-term project like one typically does in undergraduate research.  Regarding your second question about developing an aptitude for research: keep in mind that there are many different types of research projects, which rely on different types of talents. For instance, some people are great at big- picture thinking, some people are great at clever solutions to tricky questions, some people have the patience to do enormous amounts of seemingly routine things which put together can yield great results, and so on. The main thing you should strive for is to find some area of your subject, and some way of working on that area, which you love to do and which matches your particular talents. Don't get discouraged about not having great success in one particular project -- maybe that project just wasn't the right fit for your particular skills. I can tell you that one of the keys to \"aptitude for research\" is to have a kind of psychological toughness that enables you to keep working on a problem for a long time, despite setbacks. If you love what you do, and you have that type of resolve, then good things will happen.  "

      "question_body": "  My situation is as follows: I spent my undergraduate time at one university and recently entered grad school at another university (both of them in Germany, my field is theoretical computer science).  For my Bachelor's thesis, I worked (for about two months or so) on a topic that had not been considered at the time.  My former supervisor, although he proposed the topic, is not (at least not for the last 30 years) actively doing research in that specific area, which resulted in me ending up quite on my own. However, I could get some new results. They were, of course, not groundbreaking, but sufficient for the undergraduate level and the amount of time spent working on the thesis.  So we submitted the results to a (medium-to-low-ranked) conference in the subfield. The reviews were quite mixed. Two were rather superficial: One positively and recommending acceptance, one negatively and recommending rejection (actually, the latter one was quite rude).  The third one, however, although recommending for rejection, was quite encouraging. The reviewer liked the idea of the paper, while the results we obtained did not suffice for publication at conference level but (his words) were rather suited for venues for work in progress, e.g. workshops in the area.  I actually agree with the third reviewer, for it would have been quite a surprise for me if a second-year undergraduate would have been able to produce publishable work on his own just like that, so I am not that disappointed.  My problem is that I do not plan on pursuing that specific subarea of research in the future and neither does my former supervisor. However, given that I ultimately aim for an academic career, I think it might be worth some efforts to get something published. Additionally, at my new university, nobody really cares about the area of the thesis, so chances to get some expert here to work with in order to improve the results are rather bad. This means that if I want something to happen, I would have to invest a vast amount of time and thoughts into a topic I don't want to pursue in the future, instead of entering new areas of research as quickly as possible.  So: Should I improve the results and finally get them published or should I invest the time for acquiring knowledge in a different area (and start publishing later) and abandon the work that has been done (giving away a possible publication) (w.r.t. the impact of the outcome on my academic career)?

If you get encouraging comments and know what to do to meet certain criteria you can probably assess how much work will be involved and then if you are willing to put in that effort. having something published is never wrong, even if it is not in the field you want to pursue. If you are not interested or do not want to spend the time then it will be harder to generate the necessary improvements.  So, if you want to pursue a career in research, having something tangible published is always a plus.

I think having a positive review suggests it might be worth factoring in the comments and trying another submission elsewhere, assuming you're confident that the paper is technically sound.  Just to build on the other answers, I can see three options (with decreasing awards):    1. Work hard on the paper (if possible) and submit it to **a conference with a similar level of competition** (or perhaps even greater).    2. Work a little on the paper and submit it to **a good/relevant workshop** or as **a short paper to a conference**.    3. Submit the paper \"as is\" to **the[arXiV](http://arxiv.org/) e-print server** (which won't be peer-reviewed, but it will be publicised and the ideas will be marked as yours).  At your stage of career, taking any of these options would help open doors for you later on. Higher options open more doors.  Which strategy is best really depends on the depth of contribution in the paper (ideally you could discuss this in person with a more senior academic in roughly the same area). Note also that the options are not mutually exclusive.  The most generic advice would be to take option 3 now and submit the preprint (since it doesn't preclude submitting to a workshop/conference), work as hard as you can and try submit to another conference; if the reviews are similar, submit to a workshop or as a short paper. This strategy might involve more work but tries to maximise your profit.  A fourth option (which may or may not be feasible) is to take option 3 and then try find somebody else to collaborate with: someone to advise/guide you and share some of the workload in extending the paper towards an improved conference submission.

Introductions, conclusions and \"linking\" material between sections are written in order to support your overall argument (for example, by summarizing higher- level ideas) or to assist the reader (for example, by letting them know something about what they are about to read). So you need to think about the needs of each part of your document, and how the whole thing fits together, to discover where introductions and conclusions ought to be placed.  Introductory material does not need to be very long, and it does not need to occupy its own section. Within a chapter, it's perfectly fine to have a short introductory passage before the first numbered section. For smaller divisions of your document, it's likely that you don't need to say very much in the way of introduction. When you find yourself writing an introductory sentence that doesn't add anything to the section heading, you are better off just omitting that sentence.  Readers can be served by short \"hints\" at the beginning or end of a section, that explain how the topics are linked together. This sort of thing lets you move more smoothly from one topic to another, and makes your overall argument more coherent. Without using many words, you can let readers know whether the new topic is:    * A later counterargument to the material in the previous section.   * A supporting argument from a different perspective.   * An additional example of the same thing we have just seen.   * Superficially different, but actually the same underneath.   * etc.  This is much better than having a template introductory sentence that just says \"This section is about ...\" without giving any indication how the section fits in to the overall structure.  Conclusions are the same: for a short section, there's no need to sum up what's just been said. That doesn't add anything. In particular, for a literature review chapter, you are likely to be better off having a general conclusion to the chapter (if there is a conclusion at all), rather than a separate conclusion in each section.

If you think for some reason your advisor will be reluctant to include you as an author, you can do some preparation for your talk with them as follows.

Then, if your advisor's first response is \"No\" and you disagree (after listening to the reasoning), you can present your side (which your advisor may or may not agree with).  Also, if your advisor's assessment is \"No, you haven't done enough to warrant authorship,\" you can ask \"What else I can do before paper submission that will 'bump' my contribution up to authorship level?\" I have had students in the past whose contribution to a paper didn't warrant authorship. In those cases, I told them: \"Your current contributions do not merit authorship (only acknowledgement), but if you also do X, Y, Z, you will be an author.\"  (Note: I'm _not_ advising any kind of escalation at this point - you don't even know yet what your advisor will say! But you may feel more comfortable with some kind of plan in mind for how to explain your contributions (as you understand them) to your advisor _if_ advisor says \"No\" and you don't think advisor fully understands your side.)

In fact I think that every young person doing work which is being used in any way in a published academic paper would do well to ask this question. If you like, you can frame it not as your trying to suss out whether you have been unfairly denied coauthorship but that you are looking to learn more about the research process itself and inquiring into what sort of research contributions merit coauthorship. (Even if you are seeking to do such a sussing out, framing it as a teachable moment is probably a better way to get a helpful, unguarded response.)  In my experience, things go smoothly if the issue of coauthorship is raised earlier in the collaborative process rather than later. It is hard for me to think of a situation in which it is \"too soon\" to ask this question, although if you ask it early enough the answer may not be definitive. It is not good to be working on something and wondering whether one will wind up as a coauthor or not. That's needlessly stressful.  Also in my experience, undergraduates often have unrealistic expectations about what sort of work merits publication and/or coauthorship. It seems, especially on this site, that a lot of undergraduates are hoping that their undergraduate research can be published. In some cases it can, and how feasible this is must be highly field-dependent, but here is an inherent feature of undergraduate research: it is research done by someone who has much less subject-area knowledge and insight than _she will herself have later on_ , assuming she continues in the discipline.  (If you don't continue in the discipline then you should ask yourself seriously why you want to be published in it. Getting anything published anywhere sounds neat to any suitably bookish young person -- and it sounds neat to me too, and I am a published author -- but the reality of it is that academic publication takes a lot of time and work over and beyond the work that was done to write the paper. If you are a 20-year old who has written an electrical engineering paper and then decided to go on to some other career, please think seriously about just putting that paper on your webpage and spending the time that it would take to get your paper published learning to play the guitar, or watching Lars von Trier films, or finding a cute boyfriend/girlfriend, or...almost anything else, really. If you don't continue on in the discipline, then having a published academic paper is worth essentially nothing beyond the neat feeling you get by being published. It does not convey the real life advantages that, say, being able to talk knowledgeably about [Dogme95](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogme_95) would.)  Note well: I am not saying that undergraduates cannot do good research. They can: in rare but extant circumstances, undergraduates have done research which is better than what most other people in the field can do. What I am saying is that almost every undergraduate who does research will do significantly better research a little later on, to the extent that I cannot think of a situation in which someone's undergraduate research became a big part of their professional profile.  **Added** : I did not mean to create the impression that I feel that in this particular case the OP's contributions do not merit coauthorship. I can't know without knowing the details of the situation, and I wouldn't be a good judge anyway because I work in a field -- mathematics -- where the standards for what constitutes coauthorship are very different from in EE. Let me reiterate the points that I did make:  (i) The advisor is much better equipped to understand whether the student's work merits coauthorship than the student. So statistically speaking, if a student is unsure about this, asks the advisor, and the advisor says the student has not done enough for coauthorship, the advisor is probably right. Of course this unequal expertise and authority sets things up perfectly for a predatory advisor to exploit his undergraduate workers. My answer is mostly directed towards the higher probability event that the advisor is acting honorably. The main thing I advised the OP to do was to talk to his advisor about the standards for coauthorship. I feel very strongly that this is the correct first step (and should have been taken before, in fact, since the OP has some anxiety about the situation). If what the OP hears in this conversation is very unsatisfactory to him, then we can further discuss the situation. I don't want to assume that will happen.  (ii) The line between getting acknowledged and getting coauthorship is certainly a gray area, even among adult academics. For example, in the last few months alone I was invited to be a coauthor on two different papers. I had to think about each one. In the end, I turned down one request -- which came from two graduate students in my own department, including one of my own advisees -- and accepted the other _after doing more work_ so that I felt like my coauthorship was justified. Both of these could have gone either way. When I think about whether to include myself or someone else as a coauthor, first I weight intellectual contributions (in a way which may not generalize so well outside of mathematics, which is something I have recently learned by discussion with other members of the site) and second I think in terms of the professional implications of putting on or leaving off a certain person's name. The paper that I left my name off of was the third paper coming out of a graduate research seminar organized and led by me [I was a coauthor on the first two], and the results obtained were ones that I specifically asked for. Nevertheless the work done on this paper was by the students and not by me* -- my own direct contribution to this work was positive but indubitably of a smaller order than theirs -- and the advantage to each of these students of having a paper which does not have a faculty coauthor is considerable. For me, having one more publication of a similar sort as the other two is not a big advantage to me. In fact, by not putting my name on the paper I am in fact claiming a sort of academic seniority: I'm showing that I've reached a certain point in my career where I can successfully inspire and direct projects that I am not directly involved with. So my answers come from the perspective of a faculty advisor who thinks carefully about which names to put on or leave off a paper...including his own. This behavior does not make me an unusually virtuous member of my academic community: it seems like business as usual. So I would like to extend the benefit of the doubt to the OP's academic advisor and assume that he is acting honorably until specific information comes up to the contrary.  *: In fact this third work involved computations that were so substantial that although I am, I suppose, capable of having done them, in practice I would not have been willing to devote the time and enthusiasm that my students did, and it would certainly have taken me longer to write a much kludgier version of the code than what my student came up with fairly quickly.

I really don't appreciate when a student asks me how to do something _before_ they do a basic Google search.  Similarly, if a student doesn't know how to judge when he/she is \"stuck\" and needs help, this also creates a burden on the supervisor (because the supervisor has to keep checking on the student to make sure they're progressing).  The dos and don'ts (to avoid being a \"burden\") that come to mind are:    * **Do** ask your supervisor this question at the very beginning, to find out what he/she expects from you.   * **Do** take detailed notes when you have a meeting with your supervisor or somebody teaches you how to do something, so you can refer to them later   * **Do** keep a written record of your own attempts and progress (such as a lab notebook) to show your supervisor during meetings   * **Do** ask a question if you don't understand an instruction or something that is said, because it will be much better for everyone involved if you clear things up sooner rather than later.   * **Do** mention your own ideas to your supervisor, if you have some that you think will make your research better.   * **Don't** think that just because you are an undergraduate, you can't make much of a contribution. Obviously experience helps, but it's really only a small piece of what makes someone a skilled researcher. Willingness to learn is a much bigger piece, IMO. I've had high-school summer interns who were better than any of the M.S. students in the lab, simply because they put in more effort to _learn_.  * Source of the quote: _The Unwritten Rules of PhD Research_ , by Marian Petre & Gordon Rugg  "

Secondary benefits include advancing science and the careers of the participants. Note that these are not the same goals as of a PhD program (such as in ff524's answer).  The very natural desire to be a \"skilled and efficient researcher\" is orthogonal to these goals; in some circumstances it will be counterproductive to be skilled and efficient. Your supervisor sees the whole project while you only see what's been set in front of you.  You should set your goals as:    1. To learn as many details of the lab dynamic as possible.   2. To participate in the lab dynamic in the manner you are expected to.   3. To do the tasks you are assigned in a skilled and efficient manner.   4. To noticeably improve in your abilities and understanding, over the course of the program.   5. (stretch goal) To have a good and creative idea that transcends the tasks you were assigned. Share this idea with your supervisor; do not just implement it. Do this at most once during the summer.  To expand a bit on (2): Listen carefully, including to body language. Your supervisor has a role in mind for you. Different faculty have different expectations with regards to issues such as creativity, asking questions, frequency of meetings, quality control, etc. You need to meet these expectations as well as you can. Exceeding expectations may not be a good thing; that's why I recommend doing it at most once.  "

There are a couple of extremely accomplished professors in fluid mechanics here, which is what I want to study in grad school. However, I am not so interested in attending this school for graduate school because it does not send many people to academia post-graduation, despite being a top 5 program, mostly because it isn't a very big name school. Or at least I assume this is the reason.  The deadline to reply to this school is March 5th.  To complicate things, I am waiting on a reply from a much more prestigious university for a summer internship. While the school has a much better name, its ranking is slightly less (number 6 for chemical engineering). I think I have a very good chance of getting this internship (my PI went to grad school here and wrote a very strong letter, plus I have a good resume otherwise). However, I learned today that they will NOT be able to get a response back to me before March 5th.  I am much more interested in attending School 2 (slightly lower rank, better name), because they very frequently send people to academia, which is my long term goal.  School 1 (higher rank, worse name) was pretty firm in the March 5th date, so I don't think I can ask for an extension.  Financially, School 1 offered me a slightly better deal, I'd be netting about 2k more over 10 weeks. However, that isn't as important to me, since the experience is worth far more than the money.  I apologize for the long question, but any advice or guidance would be appreciated. Am I putting too much emphasis on the name and rank?

Since you have a fairly strong inclination to working in academia, you do not need the experience other than to confirm your suspicions and to make you a better candidate when you apply to graduate schools.  As for what I would suggest --- ask when you think the earliest day / time you would be able to get a response from School 2 on acceptance or rejection, and then from there, try to see if you can eke out some more time on School 1's deadline so that you don't end up shooting yourself in the foot.

Basically, the research experience is the most important factor for me to decide my college, since I want to be a strong applicant in PhD admission.

Just for example, Reed College has mandatory Senior thesis like Princeton, and profs are eager to help even Sophomores to do their research.

        "answer_body": "  I went to a small liberal arts college and worked at a large university lab, that had undergraduate interns. From both experiences I agree that it is the lab and not the school that matters. However, there are conditions that you will be more or less likely to find, depending on the type of school. In general liberal arts colleges will give you more personal attention and large universities will have more resources. Funding at liberal arts colleges is focused on undergraduate education and funding at larger universities is focused on research.  **Personal Attention:**  _Liberal arts:_ A lab is led by a principal investigator or PI. Liberal arts colleges often do not have graduate students or have few graduate programs. So, at a small liberal arts college you will work closely with your PI and get to know them well. I left my college with great letters of rec that helped me overcome a poor GPA (due to a medical problem in my first two years) and get into grad school.  _University:_ The undergrads were trained by PhDs and post docs and had little contact with the faculty. Post docs and PhDs can often be great teachers, though, since they either are students or were students recently and might be able to anticipate the student's perspective. At a university, they will normally write your letters of recommendation and the faculty will sign them.  **Independence:**  _Liberal Arts:_ All of our grants were training grants, so the emphasis was on teaching, as opposed to producing results. This means you will get to do more independent work. I got first hand experience with the equipment (EEG) and techniques (analysis of FMRI and EEG data) that few undergraduates get to use. Additionally, I know of at least two of my friends who published, as first authors, in major research journals. This is not uncommon in my school.  _University_ : The undergrads had to learn a program that is no longer used by most labs in the field. There was little room for mistakes (all of the labs grants were research grants), so the undergrads were given the task of modifying previous work and really did not develop any understanding of how the program actually works. However, this lab was an older lab. I also believe students at an older lab at my undergraduate school had a similar experience, where the methodology they were taught was not consistent with current standards in the field.  **Connections:**  They are pretty equal in this area. Liberal arts college professors often collaborate with people at larger institutions and can connect you with other labs. I have friends who got summer jobs at Stanford and CalTech this way. At the large university, one of our undergrads got to go to Oxford for the summer, because of the professor's connections to a lab there.  **Equipment and Resouces:**  _Liberal arts:_ We did not have access to some of the most expensive equipment (an MRI, for example). However, one of my professors also worked at a local university that had access to an MRI and we got to use it there. Ideally, you should get some lab experience at a major research university, so you are exposed to techniques that require more expensive equipment. You can do this during summer internships. Getting more experience at different labs will look good on your application.  On that note, a liberal arts college is more likely to have grants that will help students study at other institutions. My college had several such grants for student research grants. Additionally, all senior thesis was funded by the department. The senior thesis funding and one of the summer fellowships both require students to focus on their own original ideas. In most fields the first author is the person who had the idea for the project. This is how undergraduate students were able to become first authors.  _University:_ Universities will have the best equipment, but they are less likely to have funding for student research. The institution I worked at had grants for students, but they were only for work at that university. They also had no specific grants that would allow students to propose their own projects, based on their own ideas.  "

Generally speaking, the best way to do this, in my view, is to email the professor, give them a brief introduction about yourself, your research interests, that you're applying for the SURF program, and that you'd like to work in their lab. Link this to the work they do.  I'd consider doing this for several professors, unless there's just one whose work matches your own. Worst case, they'll ignore it, but professors often at least read these, especially if they're from institutions they recognize, have concrete information, and are in coherent English.  For the record, this is how I got my first undergraduate research position, and ended up with a wonderful colleague I work with to this day.  "

You cannot wire money to Cuba, and you cannot legally exchange US dollars for Cuban currency. Staying in approved hotels and eating at approved restaurants is very expensive. Using the black market and finding less official housing and food is difficult and I think would be beyond a typical undergrad.

[Writing for Computer Science (Zobel)](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/1852338024) This is a decent book on explaining the principles on why and how you should write computer science articles. It's very computer science specific, with a bit more emphasis toward databases and operating systems, but I think it's applicable to most technical fields (of which computational linguistics should fall into).  I like this one because it's a general guide to writing that outlines the process and the structure.  [Elements of Style (Strunk and White)](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/020530902X) A commonly- recommended book that a lot of people swear by but I found it a bit too low- level for my liking and actually had a hard time finishing it. A professor described it as \"too prescriptive\".  [Bugs in Writing (Dupre)](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/020137921X) This is an okay book as a reference manual for improving your prose, but isn't a good guide for figuring out the writing process. There's good advice in this book (and it's actually rather fun to flip through just to learn about various style points) but can be difficult to use as an actual guide.  [Style: Toward Clarity and Grace (Williams)](http://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/0226899152) I've gotten through a few parts of this book and it gives very specific advice on how to proceed on improving your writing, especially explaining specifically how to introduce ideas in paragraphs, how to flow them together to create longer manuscripts, and how to restructure and correct text so the main ideas come through. As I surmised, it is in fact very analytical and detailed and does describe the rationales behind its recommendations. I think this book is a great resource for those who have some words written, who know they have to make their writing \"flow better\" or \"more clear\" but aren't really sure how to do it. It appears to be an especially valuable book for the \"second pass\" through anything, where you have written down your initial ideas in part- writing, part bullets, and are trying to convert it into a real readable piece of work. (Previously, I wrote: This book was JUST recommended to me and I haven't read it, but it is apparently very analytical and detailed, and outlines the rationales behind why one should write in the way it discusses. In fact, I think there a jab at the Elements of Style in this book where the author laments that \"Be clear\" is GREAT advice. We all KNOW that. The real problem is, \"How is it that I can actually implement 'be clear' in my writing?\" However, I haven't gotten far enough to comment on it yet.)  So there's a little about what to read. As for what you should know? Well, that's a more difficult question :)  "

Moreover, I italicized these objectives. The reasons I did it were  a) some of the sections were devoted to things that are known to experts but hardly to the \"general audience\", so which sections to read and which to skip would heavily depend on the reader's general background  b) If you read the italic font alone, you can see the general flow of the proof without computations or technical details. You may then concentrate on \"most suspicious\" or \"least known\" places first.  I had mixed feelings about doing so too, but it looks like the readers have liked it so far. In general, the main question you should ask yourself is whether what you do will facilitate the reading. Everything else (paper economy, stylistic beauty, etc.) is secondary. If you expect 20-50 people to read what you wrote and if you can spare each of them mere 20 minutes (the minimal time needed to verify the ubiquitous phrase \"direct computations yield\"), you advance the general human progress by 7-14 hours already.  Note that what I did was different from the \"Chapter\" approach because I put only one complete logical step into each section. Also it was not about the Lemma/Sublemma/... division, which more often than not reflects the technical convenience rather than the logical structure. Some sections contained several lemmata needed to carry out the corresponding logical step and some lemmas were done in two steps.  The last thing I want to say is that, when reading, most people, including myself, prefer a repetition to an omission, and being over-informed to being under-informed, so few people, if any, will criticize you for being too clear or too slow.

When you approach someone, does not matter at what level, you need to show how you can be of interest. What that entails is showing you have the background (courses and scientific literature) that allows you to be efficient help. I think this is where the plan is most likely to fail because the recipient of the request will not likely be interested in taking on help that needs much coaching to function. If your request is within the department where you study, matters might be easier but if you contact someone in another university of perhaps even department the difficulties may arise.  So, I cannot see anyone being offended by a request such as this. The problem lies in seeing how you can fit in and be a contributor without to much costs (in terms of e.g. time) for the researcher or research group. However, a personal visit is far more likely to lead somewhere than a letter or E-mail.  Requests such as these are not uncommon but in my experience have most often been very uninteresting. Again, some have visited which has provided a very good possibility to assess the common interests and in what way a possible \"collaboration\" would work.  As for the last question, I cannot see a problem except that a PhD student may not be in a position to bring in an external person into a project that in essence is run by their advisor. A PhD student, on the other hand, may be a good way into a research group since they may be open to a meeting more readily than a busy project leader.  So, showing interest is good but you need to be able to show clearly what you bring to the table to wet the appetite of the person you target.  "

        "answer_body": "  Faculty in such situations might be expected to provide research experiences commensurate with the size and scope of the institution. Undergraduates usually cannot devote the time to a project that a graduate student does, so the outcomes are different. Publications are not generally expected; conference presentations are more common. Most importantly, the undergraduate gets experience working on a complex problem and develops transferable research skills. What the faculty member gets is [not the same as what he or she would get from graduate students.](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/592/do-professors- benefit-from-undergraduate-research)  What an undergraduate does as research depends on the facilities, infrastructure, and culture of the institution. At a major research institution, undergraduates should be working on the same types of problems graduate students work on, but perhaps in a more limited scope. When I was a grad student, we had several undergrads in our lab, one of whom was grad student quality and got some publications. The others contributed valuable (if not always publishable) work to our projects.  At a smaller institution that maybe does not have a graduate progran (like where I am now), you give an undergraduate student work commensurate with the type of grants you are expected to write. My institution (and my department especially) does not emphasize pursuit of large external grants, and so the types of projects I can give to my students are more limited. At the undergraduate stage, [the process is more important than the results](https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/2115/how-to-ensure-a- research-idea-has-not-been-explored-previously/2121#2121). I regularly send my students to regional and national conferences, and I hope to eventually have them publish something, but I am not given low evaluation marks. However, if you are expected to apply for and get big grants, then your undergrads should be doing work at that level.  All in all, in the chemistry departments I have been a part of (large and small), most faculty have one or more undergraduates doing research and most undergraduates get the opportunity. However, not all undergraduates choose to, nor would their be enough opportunities to support them if they did. The onus is on the undergraduate to choose to do research, not on the professor to guarantee an opportunity is available to all students even if they do not want it.  "

        "answer_body": "  My perspective is mostly Australian on this (with a bit of UK thrown in). \"Research Experience\" for undergrads here typically means exposure to and training in the methods of research. On one side this includes simply exposing undergraduates to the latest (important) results, but also incrementally introducing them to _how_ to be a researcher, capped in the final year with an offering of a small research project. Such a project would not be expected to produce new results, but to demonstrate the student's capability with methodology.  Having said that, there does seem to be an implicit push to get people publishing earlier, which seems to filter down from the increased pressure to publish on academics - but that's another story.  Still, in general, it tends to be in my experience about exposure, rather than an expectation that the undergraduate will actually perform (individual) research. The ones that do are just a bonus.  "

        "answer_body": "  Note: my perspective is from doctorate-granting biology departments in the USA  Undergraduate research experience comes in two flavors -- work-study (paid) or for class credit (often a senior/honors thesis). Both are valuable, and I expect that most departments do not have very specific expectations for professors aside from some basic effort to provide undergraduate research opportunities. Professors at these institutions are judged based on both research and teaching, and undergraduate research is just a small part of the teaching that these professors do.  You can see how universities present undergraduate research opportunities to the students (e.g. [Harvard](http://uraf.harvard.edu/icb/icb.do), [UC Berkeley](http://research.berkeley.edu/)), but I doubt that you will find publications describing how these programs influence faculty promotions. Faculty can receive [awards](http://research.berkeley.edu/distinguished/) for undergraduate mentoring. Such awards are nice to place on one's CV when applying for promotions, but that this is secondary to research, graduate student mentoring, and teaching classes.  Here is my personal opinion on undergraduate research. Even if an undergraduate is only washing dishes and making media (sterile technique!), they are still being exposed to the laboratory environment and learning what level of rigor is required to do research. Given their other commitments (such as class), their inexperience, and their limited conceptual preparation, undergraduates should not be expected to accomplish anything of note. Their inclusion in research projects should be structured to support and advance the work of full-time lab members, with the expectation that undergraduates will learn from any exposure to research projects. Finally, they can provide graduate students and post-docs with the opportunity to learn how to be mentors themselves, which is an essential part of their training.  "

The **quality** of work is **low** , but the undergraduate has **no time to improve it**.  **Should the undergraduate publish it to a random and low-tier conference to at least have a publication?**  OR  **Should he or she just make it a technical report instead of publishing it?**  In other words, during the PhD admission, **how do the admission committees or professors view a low-quality conference paper?** Do they take it as an advantage in the sense that most of the undergraduates have none.

        "answer_body": "  IMHO being paid or not doesn't matter at all (e.g. a PhD student payed by a scholarship doesn't list the scholarship as affilitation but the university, funding goes into the acknowledgements).  _I'd list both adresses_  What matters is that there is an official relationship. Official relationships the student has with both universities:    * MU for the studies (not going there outside lecture time doesn't matter - you are allowed to study at home after all, and noone forces you to use their library). MU is also where you are now while writing up the paper.   * UU for the internship. Presumably there is some kind of supervision agreement or something.   Possibly an explanation that you were at MU as an internship (summer) student would be good (e.g. acknowledgements: thanking your supervisors - particularly if your MU supervisor is not coauthor of the paper?).  Unlike the situation in the linked question, here it is clear that MU officially wanted you to do the internship (and for the internships I know you usually also have supervisor at MU), and UU officially had you over there to do the internship.  But looking up how we deal with this, I find that all three possibilities are used in practice:    * giving only MU, as this is the \"main\" affiliation of the student (I think nowadays I'd give both affiliations - but my UU supervisor entered the affilations, so if he's OK with me being MU only, that's fine with me)   * giving only UU (I'm at the UU side, but I know the project is also a consulting project for studies at MU. But AFAIK no supervisor from MU was actively involved in the student's work.)   * giving both affiliations. Having multiple affiliations is increasing in my field as we have more and more interdisciplinary centers, and people give institute adresses rather than the university or the department. Working at a non-university research institute, students here usually have an affiliation with both our insitute and the university.   * * *  Update: policies    * At my institute, the policy is \"discuss with the director\".

This data-set, to my knowledge is one of a kind.  Now in graduate school, I had come up with a research idea, and this data-set that I made would be perfect for my research. My research idea is not related to my previous professors, though as of yet, he has no present publication for the research he was doing when I was working for him.  My question is, would it be ethical for me to use this data-set for my own research when I had made it while being employed for my previous professor.

As your supervisor seems to be very busy, he probably cannot take that role.  My advice would be to get someone senior, like a PhD student or, even better, post-doc with related research interests on board. It's probably best to get someone from your supervisor's group. You should also discuss this with your supervisor first, maybe he/she can even recommend someone.

My task consisted of API development, working with Matlab and various stuff important for the project.  Yet, I did not come up with something new. Well, they did.  So, this is far better than what many students mention as research experience. But, is it worth calling this a research experience in my CV or applications? Shall I call this reaserch?

The idea behind these application questions is to try to differentiate people with no experience from some minimal experience (cleaning instruments in a lab and feeding rats) to moderate experience (sounds like what you have) and people who engaged in truly independent research (which is pretty rare, depending on where you did your bachelor degree and in what field).

This relates directly to your question:  > Will I have enough time to write [a paper]?  Without knowing what you're planning on researching, or how it will turn out, this is unanswerable. Writing a research paper for publication isn't as simple as saying you're going to do it -- you have to have a legitimate problem to work on, the tools and ability to produce a novel contribution regarding that problem, and the drive to make it happen. Then, of course, you have to actually write and edit the paper, put together any graphs or other figures that demonstrate your contribution, find a suitable conference (or journal or workshop, etc.) to publish the paper in, and then actually submit it by the deadline.  All of that said, your idea to ask professors about joining their research groups is a good one. With this plan, you have the potential to:    1. Find out if you enjoy and have the temperament for research.   2. Get mentorship from a professor, grad students, or other more experienced undergraduates.   3. Find out what problems are interesting and worth pursuing.   4. Practice the steps of going from idea to published results.  Once you find a professor to work with (and again, I suggest phrasing your request in terms of why you are interested in computer science research, and not on the means to getting into graduate school), you will start getting answers to the other questions, like what specific conferences you might want to shoot for. Obviously, it behooves you to plan ahead in order to meet conference deadlines, but until you start the research, you won't be able to determine whether you will eventually have enough good results to put together a paper.  As a general guideline, it would not surprise me if you can find a good problem to work on and submit it to a workshop or conference within a year and a half. You might also be able to work on an ongoing project and end up as an author on a paper or two that come from this work. Good luck!  "

        "answer_body": "  > _How long does it usually take to publish a first research paper?_  That question depends on a lot of factors. Here are a few of them:    * What is the significance of your research?   * How much of your research is unique, novel, and relevant?   * Will other computer scientists be interested in your findings?   * How well can you write? How well can you organize your paper?   * Where do you intend to publish?  Some conferences and publications are more competitive than others. (Put another way, some have a lower acceptance rate than others.) Much of that depends on who sponsors the conference or publication.  First, you have to do the research (this is not trivial). Significant findings need to come from that research (this doesn't always happen). You have to write that in a way that will appeal to the community (the community can be rather fickle sometimes). Lastly, you have to find some venue where the work can be presented (it's not always easy to find a good match).  If a paper gets rejected, it could be because:    * The research doesn't report anything new or significant   * The research doesn't report anything of interest to the community   * The paper is poorly written   * The paper doesn't cite other related research, leading to a credibility problem   * There simply wasn't room for your paper in the publication, or it wasn't a good match for that venue  Getting back to your original question, you might be able to publish in a year, if everything goes very smoothly. However, that's a huge \"IF.\" Even established researchers can spend years getting ready for a publication, only to see it be rejected by a committee.  Publication can be a long and arduous process, with plenty of opportunities for obstacles, setbacks, and dead ends. It can be very hard to estimate a timetable, particularly for a first-timer going from start to finish.  Your best bet might be to see what's going on at your university, and see if you can get involved with an established, ohgoing research effort. Before you do that, it might be worth doing a self-evaluation first, so that you're prepared to tell a faculty member what you can offer the research team. For example, perhaps you're a crack programmer, and a research project at your institution needs some software written, in order to complete an experiment or simulation. That might be a more realistic way to get started as a researcher.  "

        "answer_body": "  If you think your advisor made an error, then I would suggest you figure out how to _prove_ he made an error. This is the first step to showing someone they've made an error without being ignorant or arrogant (the rest follows from general customs about politeness, but you absolutely must do this first bit. He supposes, presumably in good faith, that he proved something to you; the \"burden of proof\" that he's wrong now lies in your hands). Besides, this is a good exercise. Lots of things don't seem like they make sense until you yourself figure out how to make them make sense to you. This can be a lot of work. This act of \"hacking\" someone else's grand idea until it makes sense to me is how I spend most of my time. Thankfully this often leads to totally new ideas and directions that the first guy didn't see (or thought too trivial or obviously wrong to mention, yes that happens too...)  The problem is that, in very many fields, undergraduates _are_ actually extremely frustrating to work with. They don't yet speak the language, or have the baseline knowledge that all of your colleagues share. But nonetheless, this person is not the ideal advisor if he lacks the patience to put up with a lot of questions -- this is _absolutely_ normal behavior for an undergraduate advisee, totally to be expected and many advisors find the interactions quite rewarding!  On the other hand though, you have some hard questions to ask yourself. Basically, you say that you want to ask questions without sounding lazy, but you must be honest with yourself about whether or not you are in fact asking lazy questions. The research process (again, at least in fields I'm familiar with) is most emphatically _not_ \"do exactly what some famous guy told you to do.\" It generally involves painfully slogging through material that _no one_ really understands and proving everything you think you know to yourself repeatedly, and then to others, and then occasionally having it pointed out that you made a really silly assumption, or that some obscure paper already solved everything you had set out for. Again, the point is to create new knowledge, and so you have to know your tools inside and out. In fact, if your advisor is explaining _anything at all_ clearly and to your satisfaction, what he is explaining is, by definition, old knowledge.  "

Read as many papers as you can from high profile conferences and journals in your field. Even if you don't understand everything right now, you'll start to get a feel for where the cutting edge is, and and also about how to write good papers. You'll probably also start to see which schools publish the most papers, and if you're looking for top programs, these are probably the ones.    2. Take hard classes, and get good grades. Eventually, if you have the right prerequisites, try to take a graduate-level course or two and excel in it/them.    3. Start talking to your professors about graduate school, and try to form relationships where you will be comfortable asking for letters of recommendation. They all went to graduate school, and some will have good advice on your path. If you are doing research for a professor, especially make sure you discuss your future plans with him/her.    4. Learn [LaTeX](http://www.maths.tcd.ie/~dwilkins/LaTeXPrimer/). Although this seems like a little thing, you'll certainly find it helpful to be competent in LaTeX during graduate school.    5. Try to track down former students from your school who went on to graduate school in a similar field, and ask them about their experiences, and for suggestions about applying.    6. If your research leads to good results, attempt to publish those results. Even if you get rejected, you've at least gone through the sometimes-obtuse submission process, and it is a worthwhile exercise.    7. Start looking into scholarship and fellowship opportunities now. Even if you don't apply for a couple of years, you'll know what you may qualify for, and can start tailoring your application materials now.  "

This is encompasses aeismail's answer, but I would focus on the specific goal of getting a paper published. Every student project you do, ask yourself what kind of results would make your professor say \"we should publish this\". This has the following advantages:    * Publishing a paper takes some psychological development. You need to be able to deal with the drudgery of finishing a project without procrastinating, and getting it to a certain level of quality. If you can show that you've already mastered this skill, you will be a much more valuable PhD student.   * It forces you to work to a higher standard, so you'll learn more, and you'll focus on the details that are important for research work.   * It gives the person evaluating you for a position something to look at that is much more informative than a grade list or a CV.  Of course, if the threshold to PhD-ship is an exam rather than an interview, you should study with the exam in mind, but the goal of publishing while you're still an undergrad will help you be a better PhD student once you get in.

My work here could potentially turn into a publication. It's worth noting that I've technically already accepted this position. I didn't get the offer for the next one until after I had accepted this one.  The second offer is a full summer semester research internship at the uni I currently attend. I'd be working on the research I'm doing now all summer; as a result, I'd almost certainly be published by the end of the summer, possibly twice since my PI has a couple of papers that just need one more topic covered before they get fully published. It's worth noting that this internship would get me almost twice as much money by the end of it.  My question is: which should I take? I have a very good shot at the Goldwater next year, so I need to know if it would be better to be published, or to have a letter of rec/research experience at a top university.

If so, then it might behoove you to find one at another institution. This will be helpful to you, as it shows you're not just a \"system\" product.     * Is the research that you're doing something that you _know_ you want to do, or just _think_ you want to do? You will in general be more likely to have real success if you enjoy the work you want to do.    * Will the pay for the \"away\" program be sufficient to cover your living expenses and needs?

        "answer_body": "  Reading recent papers is a good way to come up with ideas for things to work on. For example, the last section of a paper often lists open problems and possible topics for future research, and they may also be scattered throughout the paper. Of course the author or other readers may be working on them, but that difficulty is unavoidable for any problem that isn't communicated privately to you. Some of the advantages of this approach are:    1. You have some evidence that the answer isn't already known. Of course maybe the author just didn't know it, but at least you are getting an expert opinion (which is particularly helpful if you aren't an expert yourself).    2. Your work may be of interest to other readers of this paper. This avoids the difficulty of making up a topic and then discovering that you are unable to interest anyone in it.    3. The published papers on the topic let you calibrate your level of knowledge. If you can read them, then you probably know enough to work on extensions. If you can't, then you need to learn more.    4. There's some reason to think progress may be possible.  By contrast, I would absolutely avoid working on famous problems. They satisfy 1 to 3 nicely, but the \"famous\" requirement specifically filters out any reasonable likelihood of a full solution, and progress towards a solution may be very difficult. Unless you are extraordinarily talented or lucky, choosing problems because of their fame is a big step in the direction of becoming a failure as a researcher or even a crackpot. Even if you are extraordinarily talented, there's no harm in starting with a warm-up goal, and this avoids the difficulty that many people have trouble estimating their own abilities.  As for how long it will take to solve a research problem, this is unanswerable. If you are really lucky, you might make important progress within a few weeks. If you get stuck in a rut or are missing some background, you might work fruitlessly for years on a problem that's not actually all that difficult. And of course problems vary enormously in their difficulty. With enough experience, you might be able to estimate how difficult or time- consuming certain problems might be, so you could guess what might make an appropriate Ph.D. thesis problem, for example. However, even experts are sometimes wrong, and developing this sort of feeling takes substantial research experience. When you are starting out, I don't think there's any reliable way to guess these sorts of things. This is one reason why Ph.D. advisors are important: they can offer feedback and advice based on intuitions the student is still developing.  If you are working on research without experience or expert guidance, you could use the following guidelines. Don't give up too quickly: anything worth publishing is worth spending weeks beating your head against with no apparent progress. (Of course I don't mean staring at a blank piece of paper, but trying ideas and discovering they don't work, looking at special cases and examples, studying background that may be relevant, etc.) Once you have a solid background in the relevant mathematics, which could take a long time depending on the field, you should probably be getting somewhere over a period of months. By \"somewhere\", I don't necessarily mean clear progress towards a solution, but you should be able to articulate an understanding of the problem you didn't have when you started, you should be coming up with tangential or spin-off ideas that may not solve the problem but could be interesting in their own right, etc. The ultimate test of successful research isn't whether you accomplish your original goals, but rather whether you find something interesting along the way. On the other hand, if months go by and you don't seem to be coming up with any interesting ideas or understanding, then this is probably not a fruitful research topic with your current level of background and experience.  Of course you shouldn't take any advice like the last paragraph too seriously. Research is a highly personal topic, and many people have different research styles. However, it may give you an idea of one reasonable approach.  "

It's perhaps a bias from my field (Computer Security), but most researchers I have met are not working on a specific problem they chose years ago, but are constantly shifting between asking new problems/questions and addressing problems/questions (raised by them or others).  There are of course some known problems, but if they are known, it's likely because there is no obvious solution, and perhaps no solution at all. One can choose to work on one of them (I heard there are people working all the time on the P/NP problem), but it's probably better to create your own problems by challenging existing assumptions (X solve this problem by assuming P is true, but I know a case where P is not true, and therefore I want to solve it also in this case), by opening new approaches (would a quantum computer help solve this problem?), by looking at the future work proposed by other researchers, etc.  It might again be a bias from my field, but I have always felt that solving problems was never a big problem (and it's actually the funniest part of the job), while finding problems worth solving is actually hard, because it requires to have a global understanding of the field, of what exists, what doesn't, why it doesn't, and what could be possible.

Maybe if the supervisor writes a paper based on your results, and with a lot of help with producing the results, this might lead to a co-authorship for the undergraduate. Therefor, I think that in the Dutch system (my experience) a peer reviewed publication would be a plus, but definitely not a requirement for admission into a masters program. Ofcourse, you need have written a thesis, but it does not have to published in a peer-reviewed journal. I do not know how this experience translate to, say, the US, but I know for countries like Germany it is not even always usual for a PhD to write peer-reviewed articles.  "

If you want to simple familiarize yourself with \"what research entails\", I recommend simply talking to people. Ask any graduate student if you can meet them for coffee and just ask them what they do all day (other than surf the web and drink coffee). Search through the faculty profiles on your department's website, find someone who looks interesting, and send an email asking to meet with them for 15-30 minutes to talk about research as a career.  If you're more interested in actually doing research, all of the above still apply, but there are two more steps. First, talk to the undergraduate coordinator for your department and try to set up a research internship over the next semester/summer. Secondly, when you're talking to faculty whose research interests you, ask whether they'd be willing to take undergraduate researchers in their lab. Doing research with them, even if just for a few hours a week, will give you the exposure you need to really understand what research entails.  "

Sometimes it's difficult to determine what a person is really like just from a few minutes speaking with them. I found a few particular questions to be particularly helpful:    1. Ask them what their goals are for the future. Most undergraduates give very general answers because they are not sure what they want. A highly motivated student knows what they want, and are likely to link their goals as part of the reason why they want this particular research job opportunity.     2. Ask them to describe in detail a difficult problem that they had to overcome, and explain how they overcame it. This is a question they typically anticipate, but it's the manner in which they answer that matters... Observe how well they put together their answer, how long it takes them, and how well they articulate it and its relevance to the research job that they're applying for.    3. Ask them about their greatest strengths, and greatest weaknesses. In particular, examine how they explain how their weaknesses may affect their job and how they intend to overcome these weaknesses. A strong candidate will not only be self aware and honest, but will seek ways to overcome these deficiencies.  "

Further, if the work is fundamentally flawed, the student might never get replies.   * Any other repository site (ArXiv?) might cause the paper to be drowned by more successful ones and the student might never get comments.

The best route, if at all possible, would be for one of the the local faculty to put the student in touch with someone who is active in research. The personal introduction makes it much likely that the work will get actual feedback. (I'm assuming here that the student has actually talked to the local people and determined that they're not interested; just because a faculty members isn't currently active in research doesn't automatically mean they don't care and won't be able to help an interested student.)  If that's not an option, the student might be able to meet researchers through some sort of event, either one aimed directly at undergraduates (for instance, in the US, there are many summer programs for undergraduates), or even just by attending a conference and trying to meet people. This may not be an option (summer programs require being accepted, for instance, and attending a conference on one's own can be expensive).  If that's off the table as well, it may be time to personally e-mail researchers in the area. It's true that there's some risk the work will be ignored, but there are steps that can be taken to minimize this: choose a person to contact carefully, making sure it's someone actually interested in the exact topic of your research (on the one hand, you want it to be someone you cite, or at least someone who's worked directly in the area, but on the other hand, you don't want to e-mail the biggest name who has anything to do with the subject); and write a personal e-mail which makes your situation clear without being too verbose, and which explains why you're e-mailing this particular person.

Networking\u2014you have to find people in your field in order to grow, and you can only find people in your field by networking appropriately. Try to find money in the department/broader university to attend a conference, or even just email authors of papers you cite. Describe your situation (briefly). If they're local, ask to meet with them for 30 minutes-1 hr; if not, try for phone calls.  Do note that, generally speaking, graduate students/postdocs will be more willing to give you time than advisors; try to get in touch with them as well.    2. Asking good questions\u2014you can and should assume that no one has time to act as your advisor. Because of this, your interaction with those whom advise you will be brief. Make the most of those minutes. Give a summary of your work, ask very directed, substantial questions. Make the most of your meetings.  Personally, the most productive meeting I had in the entirety of my just- under-five year graduate school stint was one with a member of my thesis committee, and the entire meeting lasted 15 minutes. I gave the right background, asked the right questions, and came away with what turned into my thesis project. (I don't think I've done that well since.) Do your homework, and you may benefit nicely.  "

      "question_title": "\"Challenging\" Teaching Experiences for Math Grad Students?  ",
      "question_body": "  I am currently a graduate student, who will (hopefully!) graduate in the next year (or two . . .). I have slowly come to realize that I enjoy teaching, and consequently want to do more of it! My main reasons are:    * to gain experience   * to bolster my CV   * to learn to be a better teacher  That last point is particularly important to me, because I feel I have received insufficient training in how to teach mathematics well.  Now, I have done the usual TA thing. For the past year, I have also been an adjunct instructor at a local four-year college, so I pretty much know what it's like to be \"fully responsible\" for a course. What I am looking for are challenging opportunities which allow me to do some\u2013or all\u2013of the following:    * teach fairly sophisticated math to bright high school students / undergraduates   * engage them in innovative thinking/research   * be consistently mentored/evaluated throughout the duration of this experience  Again, the last point is rather important to me. So my question is:  > Do such programs exist?  I am sure they do, but when Googling, I invariably come up with graduate summer schools, or \"local\" opportunities. (By \"local\" here, I mean those which are only eligible to students in that particular school's graduate program.) So I am hoping someone (or several people) here know more about it than Google does.  I know that most opportunities for this summer have probably already expired, but I want to stress I am not only focused on summer sessions. In particular, I would gladly forego my usual TA appointment for a semester, to be a part of a more difficult and rewarding experience somewhere else.  Thanks in advance.

In the two research labs I've worked in, one engineering and one neuroscience, undergraduates did a tremendous amount of useful work. In engineering, they would help with circuit design and fabrication, as well as doing background research and presenting their findings to the group as a whole. In the neuroscience lab, they would do cellular recordings and prepare cell cultures, as well as participate in paper writing.  In both cases, the undergraduates benefitted tremendously from the experience in a number of ways; they experienced the life of a researcher, they got to perform actual research work, they published articles and conference papers, and they received excellent letters of recommendation. The lab also benefitted, in that they had a (most of the time) highly motivated student who was interested in doing work performing research, the grad students/professors had more time either prepare other experiments or write papers, and all the benefits of simply having someone else around to bounce ideas off of. All in all, if the lab is organized enough to handle the logistics of providing the students with regular (non-busywork) tasks to perform, it's a win-win situation for everyone.  "

Literature pulling. Programming implementation. All of these are valuable experiences for undergrads, give them exposure not only to the field they're interested in but the \"act\" of research itself, and save time for grad students, post-docs and faculty who _could_ do these things, but instead are able to focus on the tasks undergraduates can't do.   2. Recruitment. Promising undergraduate researchers make for decent graduate student recruits.

Working with undergrads makes my chair/dean happy.  That's not a major reason for me, though. As your Brown and UC profs suggest, the enthusiasm that motivated undergrads bring to research can be very refreshing. And (in my experience, in theoretical CS) there's comparatively little pressure for the research to lead to publication, compared to work with graduate students (where unsuccessful research means they don't graduate).
